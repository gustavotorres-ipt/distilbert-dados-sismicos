we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with an anticline with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
