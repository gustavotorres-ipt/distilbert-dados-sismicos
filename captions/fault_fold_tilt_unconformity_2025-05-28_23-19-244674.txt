we see here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic deformation with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a model of a structural deformation with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
