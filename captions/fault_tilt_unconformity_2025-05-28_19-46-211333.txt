this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
