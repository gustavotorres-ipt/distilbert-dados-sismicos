this model depicts a model with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a tilt of a disconformity.
