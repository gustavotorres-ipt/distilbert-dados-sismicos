we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with an anticline.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a fold.
this image represents a subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold.
we observe here a section of low frequency and medium noise.
