we see here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we see here a model of a fold with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with an anticline with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
