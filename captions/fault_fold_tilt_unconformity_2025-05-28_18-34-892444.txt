this image represents a model of a tectonic deformation of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
