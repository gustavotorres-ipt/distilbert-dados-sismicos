we observe here a section with a structural discontinuity with a fold.
we see here a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of an anticline.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation.
