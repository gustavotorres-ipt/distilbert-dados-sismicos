this image represents a seismic image with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with an anticline with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity with low frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fold of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
