this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a model with no structural deformation.
this model depicts a 2D section of a layer-cake stratigraphy section of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a layer-cake model.
this image represents a sesimic section of an undeformed section.
we see here a seismic image with a layer-cake structural model.
we see here a subsurface representation with an undeformed section with low frequency and medium noise.
