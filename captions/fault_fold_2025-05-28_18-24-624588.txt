this image represents a subsurface model with a structural deformation with a fold of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation.
we see here a model with a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic deformation with an antiform.
