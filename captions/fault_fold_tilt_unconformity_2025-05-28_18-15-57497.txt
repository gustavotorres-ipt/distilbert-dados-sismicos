this image represents a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a structural discontinuity with a structural compression of a tilt with a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a structural deformation of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we see here a model of a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
