we see here a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a section of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a section with a dip-slip fault of an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with an angular unconformity.
