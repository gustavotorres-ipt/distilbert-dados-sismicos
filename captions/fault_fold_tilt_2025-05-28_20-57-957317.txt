this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural deformation with a folded deformation of a tilt with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
