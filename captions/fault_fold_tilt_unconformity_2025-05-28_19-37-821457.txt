this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a fold of a tilt with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural deformation of an anticline with a tilt with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a section of a structural deformation with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
