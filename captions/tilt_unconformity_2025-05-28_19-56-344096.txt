we observe here a sesimic section of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
