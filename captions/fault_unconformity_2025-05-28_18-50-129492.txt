we observe here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with an unconformity.
we observe here a section of a tectonic deformation with an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a fault with a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault with an unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
