this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform.
we see here a model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a model with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression.
this model depicts a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a folded deformation.
