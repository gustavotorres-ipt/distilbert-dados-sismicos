this model depicts a seismic image with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline with a tilt with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
