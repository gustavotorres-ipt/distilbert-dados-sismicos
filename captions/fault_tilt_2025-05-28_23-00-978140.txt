we see here a model with a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a structural discontinuity of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation of a tilt of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilt.
we observe here a section with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of an inclined horizontal beds.
