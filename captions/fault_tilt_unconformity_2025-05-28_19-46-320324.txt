this image demonstrates a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
