this image represents a model of an anticline of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity with low frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
