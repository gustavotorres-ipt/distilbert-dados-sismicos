we see here a subsurface representation of a fault of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation with a ductile deformation of a tilt with a nonconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation of a structural compression with a tilt of a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation of a tilt with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
