this image represents a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a structural compression of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with an anticline.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a fault with a structural compression.
we see here a model with a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with medium frequency and medium noise.
