this image represents a model with a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this model depicts a model of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model with a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
