this image demonstrates a model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of an antiform.
this image represents a seismic image with a tectonic fault with a structural compression with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a structural deformation with an anticline with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with an antiform of high frequency and medium noise.
