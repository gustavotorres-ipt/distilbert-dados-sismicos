this model depicts a model of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a fault with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a fault with an unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
