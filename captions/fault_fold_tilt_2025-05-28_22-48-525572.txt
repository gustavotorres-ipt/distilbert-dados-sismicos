we see here a subsurface representation of a structural deformation of a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a section with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a structural deformation of a ductile deformation with a tilt.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a model of a horizons displacement along fault of a folded deformation with a tilt with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
