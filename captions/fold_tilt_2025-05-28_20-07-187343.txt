this image represents a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a subsurface model with a folded deformation of a tilt.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression of a tilt of medium frequency and low noise.
