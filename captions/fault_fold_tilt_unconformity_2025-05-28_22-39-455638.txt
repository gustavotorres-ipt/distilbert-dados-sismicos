we see here a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation of a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic fault with a fold with a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
