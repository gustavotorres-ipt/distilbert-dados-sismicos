this image represents a sesimic section with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a model of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
