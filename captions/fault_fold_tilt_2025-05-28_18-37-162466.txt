we observe here a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a section of a structural deformation of a fold of a tilt.
this image represents a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model with a fault of a fold with a tectonic tilting.
