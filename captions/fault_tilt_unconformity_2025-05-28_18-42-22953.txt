this model depicts a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a fault of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a section with a tectonic fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
