this image demonstrates a seismic image with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression of a tilt.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds with low frequency and medium noise.
