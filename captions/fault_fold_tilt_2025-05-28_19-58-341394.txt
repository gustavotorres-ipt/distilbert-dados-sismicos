we observe here a subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a fault of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
