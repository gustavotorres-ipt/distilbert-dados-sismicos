we see here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a section of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of medium frequency and low noise.
