we observe here a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity of an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilt of an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
