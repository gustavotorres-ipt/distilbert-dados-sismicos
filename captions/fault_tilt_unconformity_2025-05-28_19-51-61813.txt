we see here a model of a geologic rigid deformation with a tilt with a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
