we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression.
we observe here a sesimic section of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline.
