this image represents a section with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression with a nonconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
