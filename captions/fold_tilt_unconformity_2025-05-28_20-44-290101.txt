we observe here a model with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a section with a tectonic compression of a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
