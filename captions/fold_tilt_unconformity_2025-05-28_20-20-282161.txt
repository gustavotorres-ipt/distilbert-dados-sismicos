this image demonstrates a seismic image with an antiform of a tilt with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a structural compression of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with an anticline of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
