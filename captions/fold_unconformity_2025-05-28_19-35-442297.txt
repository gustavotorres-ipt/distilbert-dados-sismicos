we observe here a subsurface representation with a structural compression with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model with a folded deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a folded deformation with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with an antiform with an angular unconformity.
