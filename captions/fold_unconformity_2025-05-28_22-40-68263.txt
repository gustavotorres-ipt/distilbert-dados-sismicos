this model depicts a model of a folded deformation of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression with a disconformity of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model of a ductile deformation with an angular unconformity with low frequency and high noise.
we see here a section with a folded deformation with an unconformity with low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a ductile deformation of a disconformity.
