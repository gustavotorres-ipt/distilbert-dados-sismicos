we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a 2D section of a fault with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
