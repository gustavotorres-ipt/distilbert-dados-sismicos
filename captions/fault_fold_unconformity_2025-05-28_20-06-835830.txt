this image demonstrates a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression with a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a structural compression of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural deformation with a structural compression with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic fault of an antiform of a disconformity.
