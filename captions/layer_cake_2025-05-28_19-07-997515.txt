we observe here a sesimic section of a layer-cake model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a model with no structural deformation of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a section with flat horizons.
we see here a sesimic section of a layer-cake stratigraphy section.
