this image represents a model of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a tectonic fault with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with a tilt with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a fault with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
