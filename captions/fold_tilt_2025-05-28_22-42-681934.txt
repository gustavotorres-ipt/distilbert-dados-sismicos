this image represents a 2D section of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation of low frequency and medium noise.
