we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of a fold of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a fault of a folded deformation.
we observe here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of an anticline.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of high frequency and medium noise.
