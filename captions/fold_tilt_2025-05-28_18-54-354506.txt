we observe here a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a section of a folded deformation with a tilt.
this image represents a subsurface representation of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a section with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and medium noise.
