this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a seismic image with a fault of an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic fault with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a model of a tectonic fault with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
