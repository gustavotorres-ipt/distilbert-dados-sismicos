we see here a model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation of a tilt with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic fault of a fold of a tilt of a nonconformity.
