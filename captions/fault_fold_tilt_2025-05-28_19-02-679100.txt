we see here a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a section of a structural discontinuity of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section with a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
