this image represents a subsurface representation of a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a structural compression of a tilt of an unconformity.
this image represents a section with a fold with a tilt of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression of a tilt of an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
