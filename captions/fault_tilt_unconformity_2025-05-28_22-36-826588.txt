this image represents a seismic image of low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this image represents a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
