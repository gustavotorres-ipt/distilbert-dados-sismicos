we see here a subsurface model of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation with a tilt of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression with a tilt of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
