this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
