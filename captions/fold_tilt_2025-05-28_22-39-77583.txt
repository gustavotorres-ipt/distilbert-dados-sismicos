this image represents a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a 2D section with an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a sesimic section of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
