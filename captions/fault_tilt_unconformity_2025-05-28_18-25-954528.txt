we observe here a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model of a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a dip-slip fault of a tilt with a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
