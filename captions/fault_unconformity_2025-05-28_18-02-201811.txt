we see here a sesimic section with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
