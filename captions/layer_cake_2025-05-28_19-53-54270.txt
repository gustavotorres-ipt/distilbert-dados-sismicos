we observe here a 2D section of an undeformed section.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a section with flat horizons.
this image represents a subsurface model of a flat bed stratigraphy section.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a layer-cake model with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a model with no tectonic deformation.
this image represents a sesimic section of a flat bed stratigraphy section.
