we see here a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a dip-slip fault with a tilt with a nonconformity.
