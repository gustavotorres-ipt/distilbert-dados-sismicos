we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
