we see here a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation with a fold of a tilt of an unconformity.
we see here a section with a fault of a ductile deformation of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of a fault of a tectonic compression of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
