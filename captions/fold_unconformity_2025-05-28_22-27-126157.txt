this image represents a subsurface representation with an antiform of a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section of a fold of an unconformity.
