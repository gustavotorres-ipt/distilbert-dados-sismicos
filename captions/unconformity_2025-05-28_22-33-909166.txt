we see here a seismic image of a nonconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with an unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of high frequency and low noise.
