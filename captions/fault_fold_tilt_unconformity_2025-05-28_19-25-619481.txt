this image represents a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
