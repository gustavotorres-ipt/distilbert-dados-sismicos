we observe here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation of an anticline with a tilt of a disconformity.
this image represents a model of a dip-slip fault of an anticline with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a section of medium frequency and low noise.
