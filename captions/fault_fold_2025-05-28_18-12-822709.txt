this image represents a seismic image of a fault of a fold of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation.
we see here a section of a horizons displacement along fault of a fold.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with a ductile deformation.
we observe here a model with a tectonic deformation with a fold with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a fault of a ductile deformation with low frequency and high noise.
