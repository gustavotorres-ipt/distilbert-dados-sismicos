this image represents a 2D section with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a 2D section of a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a sesimic section with an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a structural compression with a tilt.
we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression with a tilt.
