this model depicts a model with a fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
