we observe here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform of a tilt.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a sesimic section of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic deformation of a fold of a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation with a tilt.
