this image represents a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a fold of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
