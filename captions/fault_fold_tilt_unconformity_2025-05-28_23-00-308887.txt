we see here a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fault of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a fault of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a tectonic fault with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
