this model depicts a model with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a model with a structural deformation with a fold.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation.
this image represents a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation.
