we observe here a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we see here a section of a structural deformation of a fold with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation of a tilt of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a fault of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
