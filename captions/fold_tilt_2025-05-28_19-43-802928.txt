this image represents a seismic image of a folded deformation of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a section of an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
