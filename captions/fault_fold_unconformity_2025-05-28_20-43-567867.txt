this image demonstrates a subsurface model of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a fault of a folded deformation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold of a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of an anticline with an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform of a nonconformity.
this image represents a section of a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression with a nonconformity of low frequency and high noise.
