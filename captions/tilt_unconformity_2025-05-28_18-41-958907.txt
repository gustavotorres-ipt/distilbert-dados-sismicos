we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface model of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of high frequency and low noise.
