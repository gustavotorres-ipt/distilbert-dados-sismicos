we observe here a sesimic section with an anticline of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D section with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
