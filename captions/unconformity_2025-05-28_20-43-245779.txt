we see here a seismic image of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a nonconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
