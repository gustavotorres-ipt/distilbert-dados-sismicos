we see here a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we see here a model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
