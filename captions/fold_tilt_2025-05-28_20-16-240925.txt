we see here a model with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a model with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
