we see here a sesimic section of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image represents a section with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a fold with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression of a tilt with an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
