this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault of an antiform with a tilt of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a model of a structural discontinuity of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a section of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform with a tilt.
we observe here a section with a tectonic fault of a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
