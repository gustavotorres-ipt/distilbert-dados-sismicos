this image demonstrates a model with a structural deformation with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a structural deformation with an antiform of a tilt.
we see here a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting.
