this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a section with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a section of a horizons displacement along fault of an angular unconformity.
