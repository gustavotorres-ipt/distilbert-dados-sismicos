we see here a section with a dip-slip fault of a structural compression of a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a section of a fault with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a section of a structural deformation with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a model with a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and medium noise.
