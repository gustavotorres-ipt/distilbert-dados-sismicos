this image represents a 2D section of a fault of an antiform with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic compression with a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model with a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation of an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with an anticline of a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a fault of an antiform with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with an anticline of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
