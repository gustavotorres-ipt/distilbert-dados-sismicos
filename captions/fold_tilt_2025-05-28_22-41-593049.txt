we see here a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a sesimic section of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a model of a ductile deformation with a tilt.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and high noise.
