this image represents a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a fault with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a model of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with a tilt with high frequency and medium noise.
