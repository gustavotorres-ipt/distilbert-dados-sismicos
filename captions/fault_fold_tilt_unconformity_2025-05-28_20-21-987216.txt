we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this image represents a model of a tectonic fault with an antiform of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation with a tilt of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a fault with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
