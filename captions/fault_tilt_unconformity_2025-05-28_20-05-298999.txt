we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation of a tilt with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of high frequency and low noise.
