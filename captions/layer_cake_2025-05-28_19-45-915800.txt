this model depicts a 2D section of a flat bed stratigraphy section.
this image represents a subsurface representation with an undeformed section of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a model with a model with no tectonic deformation.
we observe here a sesimic section of a model with no tectonic deformation.
we observe here a seismic image with a layer-cake structural model.
