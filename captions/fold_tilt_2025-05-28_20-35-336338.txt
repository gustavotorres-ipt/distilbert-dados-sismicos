this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a section with an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting.
