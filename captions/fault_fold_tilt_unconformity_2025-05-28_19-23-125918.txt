this image demonstrates a sesimic section with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation of a fold with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a tectonic deformation with an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a dip-slip fault of a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we see here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
