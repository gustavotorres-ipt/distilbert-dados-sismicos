this image demonstrates a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a fold with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a structural deformation of a ductile deformation of an erosional unconformity.
