we observe here a section with a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic fault with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface model with a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a model with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tilted horizontal beds.
