this image represents a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a section with flat horizons.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a layer-cake stratigraphy section.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a model with no structural deformation.
