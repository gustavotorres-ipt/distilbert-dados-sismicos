we see here a model of a structural deformation of an anticline of an unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural deformation of a folded deformation of an unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a fault with a folded deformation with an unconformity.
we see here a section with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a ductile deformation of a nonconformity.
this image represents a section with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of high frequency and low noise.
