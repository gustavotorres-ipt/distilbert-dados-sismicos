we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic deformation of an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a fault of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with an angular unconformity.
