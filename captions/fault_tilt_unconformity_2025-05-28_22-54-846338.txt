we observe here a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a section of a horizons displacement along fault with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault with a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
