we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic compression of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
this model depicts a section of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
