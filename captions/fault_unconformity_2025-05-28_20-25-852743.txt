we observe here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural deformation of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation of an unconformity.
