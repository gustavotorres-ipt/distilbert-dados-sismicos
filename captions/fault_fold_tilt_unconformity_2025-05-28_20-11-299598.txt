we observe here a model of a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault of a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
