we observe here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression with a tilt with a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
