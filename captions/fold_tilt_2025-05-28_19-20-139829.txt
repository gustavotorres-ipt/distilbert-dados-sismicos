we see here a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a structural compression of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of low frequency and medium noise.
