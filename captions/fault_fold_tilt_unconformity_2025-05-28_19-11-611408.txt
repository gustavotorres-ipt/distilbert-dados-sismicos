we see here a section with a structural deformation with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of an anticline of a tilt with a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
