we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with an antiform of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
