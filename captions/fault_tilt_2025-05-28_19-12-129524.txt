this image demonstrates a model of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilt.
we observe here a 2D section of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic fault with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a seismic image of a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting.
