this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural deformation.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault.
this image represents a section with a structural discontinuity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation.
