this image represents a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of an anticline with a tilt of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
