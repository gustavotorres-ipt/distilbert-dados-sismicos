this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with an anticline with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with an antiform with an unconformity.
we see here a model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault of a folded deformation with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of an anticline of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
