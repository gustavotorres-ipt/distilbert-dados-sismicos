we see here a subsurface representation with a fault of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a section of a tectonic fault of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section with a horizons displacement along fault with a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with a disconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a structural deformation of an unconformity.
we observe here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an unconformity.
