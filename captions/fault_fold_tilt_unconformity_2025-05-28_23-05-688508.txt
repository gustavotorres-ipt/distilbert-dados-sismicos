we see here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
we see here a model with a fault with an antiform with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression with a tilt with a disconformity.
