we observe here a seismic image with a dip-slip fault of an anticline of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity with low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity of low frequency and high noise.
