this image demonstrates a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation of a tilt of an unconformity.
this image represents a section with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a fault of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
