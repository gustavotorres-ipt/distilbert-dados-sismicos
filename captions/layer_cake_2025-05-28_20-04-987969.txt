this model depicts a seismic image of a layer-cake model.
this image demonstrates a section with a layer-cake model.
this image represents a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a model with no tectonic deformation of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a layer-cake model of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of an undeformed section of high frequency and medium noise.
