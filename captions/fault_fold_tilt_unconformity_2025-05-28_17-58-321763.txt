we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a tectonic compression with a tilt of a disconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation with a fold with a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
