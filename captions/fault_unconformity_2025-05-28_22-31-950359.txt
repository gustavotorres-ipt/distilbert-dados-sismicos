this image demonstrates a subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section with a geologic rigid deformation with a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
