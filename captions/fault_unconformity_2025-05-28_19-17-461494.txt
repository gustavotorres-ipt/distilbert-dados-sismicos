this image represents a model of a fault with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a disconformity.
we see here a 2D section of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a dip-slip fault with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a fault of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
