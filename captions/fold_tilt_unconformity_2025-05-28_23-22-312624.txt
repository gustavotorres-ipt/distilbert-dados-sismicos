this image demonstrates a sesimic section of an antiform of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a section of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of an antiform with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
