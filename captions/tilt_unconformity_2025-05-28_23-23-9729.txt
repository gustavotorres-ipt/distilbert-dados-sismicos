this image demonstrates a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image represents a model of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
