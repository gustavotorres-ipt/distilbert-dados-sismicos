this model depicts a subsurface model with a fold of a tilt of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a folded deformation with a tilt with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
