this image represents a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a section with a geologic rigid deformation with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model of a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline with a tilt.
we see here a model of a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
