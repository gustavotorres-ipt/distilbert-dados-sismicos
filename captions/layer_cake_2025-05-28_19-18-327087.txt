this image represents a model of a layer-cake structural model.
we observe here a section with a flat bed stratigraphy section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a model with no tectonic deformation of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a section with flat horizons.
