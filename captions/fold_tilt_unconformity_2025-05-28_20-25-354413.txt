we observe here a section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
