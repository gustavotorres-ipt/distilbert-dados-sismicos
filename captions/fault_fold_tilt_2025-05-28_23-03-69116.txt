we observe here a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform with a tectonic tilting of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of an antiform of a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of an antiform of a tectonic tilting.
