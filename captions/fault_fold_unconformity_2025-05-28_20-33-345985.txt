we observe here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model with a fault of a tectonic compression of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with a disconformity.
