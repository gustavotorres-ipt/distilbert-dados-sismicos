we observe here a subsurface model of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of an antiform with a tilt.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds.
