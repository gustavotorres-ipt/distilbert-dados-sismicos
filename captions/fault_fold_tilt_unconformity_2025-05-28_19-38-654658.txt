this model depicts a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model with a tectonic fault with an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural deformation with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a structural compression of a tilt with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
