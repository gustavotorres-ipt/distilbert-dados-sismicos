we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural compression with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
