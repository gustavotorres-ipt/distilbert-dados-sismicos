this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a layer-cake structural model.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a model with no structural deformation.
we see here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
