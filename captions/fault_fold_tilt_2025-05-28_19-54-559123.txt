we observe here a section with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
