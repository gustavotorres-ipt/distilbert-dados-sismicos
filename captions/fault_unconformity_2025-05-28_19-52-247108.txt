we observe here a section with a dip-slip fault with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
