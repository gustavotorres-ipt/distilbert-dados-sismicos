this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fault of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
