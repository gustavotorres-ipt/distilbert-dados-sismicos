this model depicts a subsurface representation of an antiform with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a ductile deformation of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of an anticline with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural compression with a disconformity.
