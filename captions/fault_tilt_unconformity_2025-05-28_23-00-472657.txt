we observe here a subsurface model of a fault with a tilt with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
we see here a section with a dip-slip fault of a tilt of a disconformity.
this image represents a model with a structural discontinuity of a tilt with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic fault with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
