we see here a model of a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural deformation of a fold of a tilt with an unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity of an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tectonic fault with a fold of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this model depicts a model of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation of a tilt with a nonconformity of high frequency and high noise.
