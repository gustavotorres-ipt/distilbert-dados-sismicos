we observe here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
