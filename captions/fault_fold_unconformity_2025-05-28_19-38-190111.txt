we see here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault with a folded deformation with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression with a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault with a structural compression with a nonconformity of high frequency and low noise.
