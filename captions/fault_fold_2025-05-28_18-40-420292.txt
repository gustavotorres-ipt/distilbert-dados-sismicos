we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault with an anticline.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic fault with an anticline.
this image represents a model of a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation.
this image represents a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation of medium frequency and high noise.
