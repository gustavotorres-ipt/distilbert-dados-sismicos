this model depicts a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform.
we observe here a subsurface representation with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a fault with a ductile deformation.
