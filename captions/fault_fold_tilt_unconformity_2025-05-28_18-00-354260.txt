we see here a seismic image with medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model with a geologic rigid deformation of a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
