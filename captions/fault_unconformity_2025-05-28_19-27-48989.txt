this image demonstrates a model with a geologic rigid deformation with a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault of a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
