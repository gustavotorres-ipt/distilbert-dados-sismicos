this image represents a 2D section with a structural deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a model with low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a nonconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with low frequency and high noise.
