we see here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold of a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with a tectonic deformation of a fold of an unconformity.
