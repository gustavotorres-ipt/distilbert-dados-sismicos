this model depicts a model of low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with an anticline with a disconformity with low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with low frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of a disconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with low frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of a ductile deformation of an erosional unconformity.
