this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
