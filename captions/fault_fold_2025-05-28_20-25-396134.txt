we observe here a model of a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation.
this image represents a subsurface model of a fault of a structural compression.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation of a tectonic compression of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a tectonic deformation of a structural compression.
