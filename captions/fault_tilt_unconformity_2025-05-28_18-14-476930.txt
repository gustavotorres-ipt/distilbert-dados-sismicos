we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fault of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a fault of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a structural deformation with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
