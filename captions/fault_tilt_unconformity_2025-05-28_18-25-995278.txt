we see here a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
