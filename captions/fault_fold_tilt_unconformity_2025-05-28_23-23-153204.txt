this model depicts a model of a dip-slip fault of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a fold of a tilt with an unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
