we observe here a seismic image with a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault with an anticline with a tectonic tilting with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of a fold with a tilt.
this image represents a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a section of a tectonic fault with an antiform with a tilt.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
