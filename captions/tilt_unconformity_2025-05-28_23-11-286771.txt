this image represents a subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a model with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
