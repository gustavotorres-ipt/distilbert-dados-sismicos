this image represents a model with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a subsurface representation of an anticline of a tilt of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a model of an antiform of a tilt.
