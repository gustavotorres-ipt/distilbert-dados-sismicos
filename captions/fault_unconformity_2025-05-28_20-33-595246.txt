this image represents a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural deformation with a disconformity.
we see here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
