we observe here a seismic image with a tectonic compression of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a fold with an unconformity.
we observe here a section with a tectonic compression of a disconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section with an anticline with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural compression of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a fold with a nonconformity.
