this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a fold with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
