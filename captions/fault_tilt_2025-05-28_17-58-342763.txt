we see here a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a tilt with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
