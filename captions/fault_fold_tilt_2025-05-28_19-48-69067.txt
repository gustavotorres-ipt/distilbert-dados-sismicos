this model depicts a section of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a folded deformation of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a fault of a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and low noise.
