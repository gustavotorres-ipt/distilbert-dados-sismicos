we observe here a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a folded deformation of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
