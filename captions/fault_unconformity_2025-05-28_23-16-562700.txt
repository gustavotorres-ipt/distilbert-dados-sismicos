this model depicts a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a tectonic fault of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic deformation of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a fault of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
