this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a fault with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a model of a tectonic fault with a tectonic tilting with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fault of an inclined horizontal beds.
