we see here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a section of low frequency and low noise.
