we observe here a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a fault of an angular unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a fault of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with an angular unconformity.
