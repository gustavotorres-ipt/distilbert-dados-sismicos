this image demonstrates a section of a structural discontinuity of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
