this image represents a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a tectonic deformation of a structural compression with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model of a fault of a fold of a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
