this image represents a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with an anticline with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of a tilt of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a section of a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
