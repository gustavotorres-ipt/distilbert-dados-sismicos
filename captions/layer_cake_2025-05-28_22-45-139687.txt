we observe here a model of a model with no tectonic deformation of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a layer-cake structural model.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a model with no structural deformation.
we see here a 2D section of a layer-cake structural model.
