this image represents a subsurface model with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a section with a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural compression of a tilt.
