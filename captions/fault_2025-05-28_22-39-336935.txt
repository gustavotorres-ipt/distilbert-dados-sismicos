this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a rigid deformation known or fault.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation.
this image represents a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with medium frequency and medium noise.
