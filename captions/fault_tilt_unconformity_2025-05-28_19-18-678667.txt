this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a fault of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
