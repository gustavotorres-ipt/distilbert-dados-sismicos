we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
