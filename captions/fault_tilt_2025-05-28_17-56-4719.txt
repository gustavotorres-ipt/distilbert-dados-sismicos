this image demonstrates a model of a tectonic fault with an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model of a fault of an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a model of a horizons displacement along fault with an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilt.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation of a tilt.
