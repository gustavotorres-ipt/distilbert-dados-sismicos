we see here a seismic image with a ductile deformation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a folded deformation with a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with an antiform of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a folded deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation of an unconformity.
