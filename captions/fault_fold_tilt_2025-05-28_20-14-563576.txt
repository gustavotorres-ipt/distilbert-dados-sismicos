this model depicts a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a section with a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting.
