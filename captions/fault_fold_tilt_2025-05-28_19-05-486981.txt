this image represents a model with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a section with a dip-slip fault with a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and high noise.
