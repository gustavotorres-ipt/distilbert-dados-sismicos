this image represents a 2D subsurface model of an anticline of a tilt with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a tectonic compression with a tilt with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
