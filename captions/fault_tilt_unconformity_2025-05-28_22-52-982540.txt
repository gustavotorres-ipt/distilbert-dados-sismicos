this image represents a sesimic section of a structural deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section of a structural deformation with a tilt of an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
