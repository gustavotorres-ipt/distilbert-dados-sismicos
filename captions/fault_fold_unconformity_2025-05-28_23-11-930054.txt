this model depicts a 2D section with a structural deformation of a ductile deformation of a nonconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of a tectonic deformation with a fold of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and low noise.
