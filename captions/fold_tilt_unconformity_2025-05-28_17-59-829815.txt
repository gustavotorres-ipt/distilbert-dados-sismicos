this model depicts a section of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural compression of a tilt with a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of an antiform with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
