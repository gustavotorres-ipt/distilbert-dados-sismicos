we see here a 2D subsurface model with an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
