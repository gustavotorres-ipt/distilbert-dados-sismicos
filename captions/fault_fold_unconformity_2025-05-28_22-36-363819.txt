this image demonstrates a model of a fault with a structural compression with a disconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline of a disconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a section of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a section with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a fold with an erosional unconformity.
