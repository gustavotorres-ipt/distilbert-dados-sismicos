this image demonstrates a 2D section of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we see here a model of high frequency and high noise.
