this image represents a sesimic section of a folded deformation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a fold of a disconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a fold of a disconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic compression of an unconformity.
