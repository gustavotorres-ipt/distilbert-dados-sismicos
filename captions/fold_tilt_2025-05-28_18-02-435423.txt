we see here a sesimic section of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a 2D section of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting of low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting.
