we observe here a 2D section with a fault with a ductile deformation with a disconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation of an erosional unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a seismic image of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a model of a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform with a disconformity.
this model depicts a model of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
