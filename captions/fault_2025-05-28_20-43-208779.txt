this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity.
this image represents a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault.
we see here a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation with low frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation.
