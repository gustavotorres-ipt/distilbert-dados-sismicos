this image demonstrates a model of a structural compression with a tilt with a nonconformity.
we see here a section with an anticline of a tilt with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with an antiform of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
