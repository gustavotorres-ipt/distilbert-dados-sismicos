this model depicts a subsurface representation of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
