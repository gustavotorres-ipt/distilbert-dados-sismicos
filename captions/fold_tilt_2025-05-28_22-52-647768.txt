we see here a 2D section with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a model with low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with an antiform of a tilt.
we observe here a model with a ductile deformation with a tilt.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
