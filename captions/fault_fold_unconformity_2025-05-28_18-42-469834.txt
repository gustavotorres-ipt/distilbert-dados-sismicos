we see here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of an antiform of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
