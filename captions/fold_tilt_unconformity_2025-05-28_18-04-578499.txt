we observe here a model of an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with an anticline with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with an antiform of a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
