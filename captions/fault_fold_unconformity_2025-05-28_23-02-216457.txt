this model depicts a seismic image with a tectonic fault of a folded deformation with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a tectonic fault with a folded deformation of a nonconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a tectonic fault of a folded deformation of a disconformity.
this image represents a section of a fault of an anticline of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a folded deformation with an erosional unconformity.
