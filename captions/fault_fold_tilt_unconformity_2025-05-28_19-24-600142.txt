we see here a section with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline with a tilt with a nonconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a structural deformation of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
