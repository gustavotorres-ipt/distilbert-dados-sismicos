this model depicts a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a dip-slip fault of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
