this model depicts a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
