we see here a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a fault with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
