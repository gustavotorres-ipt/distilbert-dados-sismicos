we see here a 2D subsurface model of an anticline with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a folded deformation with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a ductile deformation with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic compression with a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
