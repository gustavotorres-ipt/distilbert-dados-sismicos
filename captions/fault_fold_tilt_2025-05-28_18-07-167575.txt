this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with a fold with a tilt.
we observe here a seismic image with a fault with a fold with an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural deformation of a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a section of a tectonic deformation with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a section of a structural deformation with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation with a tilt.
we observe here a sesimic section with a tectonic fault with an anticline with a tilt.
