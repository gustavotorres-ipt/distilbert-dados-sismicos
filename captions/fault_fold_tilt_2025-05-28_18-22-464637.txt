this model depicts a section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a seismic image with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic fault of a structural compression of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D section with medium frequency and high noise.
