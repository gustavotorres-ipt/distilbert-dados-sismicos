we observe here a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a section of a dip-slip fault with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with a structural discontinuity with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation with a tilt of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
