this model depicts a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression.
we see here a subsurface model of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a structural deformation of a ductile deformation with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and low noise.
