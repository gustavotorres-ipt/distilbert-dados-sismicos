this image represents a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with a tilt of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a model of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a dip-slip fault of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation.
