we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with a tilt with an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with a tilt of a nonconformity.
we see here a section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
