we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation with a fold with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural deformation of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a section with a fault with a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
