this model depicts a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with a tilt.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface model with medium frequency and low noise.
