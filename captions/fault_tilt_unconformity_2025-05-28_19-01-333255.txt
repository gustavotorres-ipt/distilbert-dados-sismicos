this image demonstrates a model with a tectonic fault with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a model with medium frequency and medium noise.
