we observe here a 2D section with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a structural discontinuity of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
