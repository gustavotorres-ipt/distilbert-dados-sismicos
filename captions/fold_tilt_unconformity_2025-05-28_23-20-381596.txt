we observe here a model with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a ductile deformation with a tilt with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a seismic image of a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
