this model depicts a model of an anticline of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a fold of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a tectonic compression of a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of an anticline of a disconformity.
this model depicts a model of a ductile deformation with an unconformity.
this image represents a model of a fold of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of a nonconformity.
