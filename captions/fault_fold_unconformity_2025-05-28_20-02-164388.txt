this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression with a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a structural compression with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a tectonic compression of a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic fault of a structural compression with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression of a nonconformity.
