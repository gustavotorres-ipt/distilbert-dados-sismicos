this image demonstrates a section with a fault with a fold with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with a structural compression with an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a structural deformation of an anticline with a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a tectonic deformation of an antiform with an unconformity.
