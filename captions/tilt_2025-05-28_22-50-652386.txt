this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a subsurface representation with an inclined horizontal beds with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a tilt with low frequency and low noise.
