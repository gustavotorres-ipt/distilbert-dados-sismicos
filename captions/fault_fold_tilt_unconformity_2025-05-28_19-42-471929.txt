this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic fault of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D section with a fault with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a fold with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
