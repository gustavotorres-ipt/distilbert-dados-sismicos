this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a fold of a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of an antiform of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tectonic compression of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a fold with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with an anticline of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural compression with a disconformity.
