this model depicts a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression with a tilt.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with a tilt of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model of a structural deformation of a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds.
