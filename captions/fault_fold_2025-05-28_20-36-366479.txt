we see here a model of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a fault with a tectonic compression of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression.
