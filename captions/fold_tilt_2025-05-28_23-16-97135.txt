we see here a seismic image of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a sesimic section of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and low noise.
