this image demonstrates a model with a structural deformation of an antiform of an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation of an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a fold with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fault with a structural compression of a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of an anticline of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with a folded deformation with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
