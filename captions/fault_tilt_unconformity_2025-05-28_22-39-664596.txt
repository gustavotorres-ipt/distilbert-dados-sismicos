this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we observe here a model with a geologic rigid deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
