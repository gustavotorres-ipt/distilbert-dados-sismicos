this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of a fold with a tilt.
we see here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with a tilt of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
