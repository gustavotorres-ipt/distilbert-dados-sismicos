this model depicts a subsurface model of a fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model of a structural discontinuity with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
