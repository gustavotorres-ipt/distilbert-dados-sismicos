we see here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
