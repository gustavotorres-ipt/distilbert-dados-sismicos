this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of a fold with an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a fault of an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds.
