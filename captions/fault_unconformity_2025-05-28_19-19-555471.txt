we see here a 2D section of a tectonic fault of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a nonconformity.
