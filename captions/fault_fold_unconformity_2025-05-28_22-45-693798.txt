this image demonstrates a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline of an unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a structural compression with an angular unconformity.
