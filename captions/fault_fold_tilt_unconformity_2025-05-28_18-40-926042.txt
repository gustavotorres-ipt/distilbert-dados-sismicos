this image represents a 2D section with a fault with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a structural discontinuity of a fold of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
