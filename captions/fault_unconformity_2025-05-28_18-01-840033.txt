we observe here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of a tectonic fault of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a model with a horizons displacement along fault with a nonconformity.
we see here a model of a dip-slip fault of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of an erosional unconformity.
