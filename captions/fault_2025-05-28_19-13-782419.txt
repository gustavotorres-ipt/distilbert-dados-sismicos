this image represents a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault.
we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
