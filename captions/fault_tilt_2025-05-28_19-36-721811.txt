this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of a tilt with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and medium noise.
