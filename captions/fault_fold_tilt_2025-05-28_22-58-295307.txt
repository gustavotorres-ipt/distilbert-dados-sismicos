this image represents a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform with a tilt.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a structural compression of a tilt with high frequency and high noise.
