this image demonstrates a section of an anticline with a tilt with a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural compression of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a section of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
