this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a section with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a seismic image with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a seismic image with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
