this model depicts a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a sesimic section of medium frequency and high noise.
