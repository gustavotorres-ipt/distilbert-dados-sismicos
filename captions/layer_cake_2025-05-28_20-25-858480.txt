we see here a section of an undeformed section.
we observe here a subsurface model of a model with no tectonic deformation.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a section with flat horizons.
