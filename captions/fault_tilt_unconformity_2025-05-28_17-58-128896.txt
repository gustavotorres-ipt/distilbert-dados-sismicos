this image represents a model of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity with low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a tectonic deformation of a tilt with an unconformity.
this model depicts a section with low frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of a tilt with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
