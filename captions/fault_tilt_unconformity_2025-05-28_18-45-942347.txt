this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
