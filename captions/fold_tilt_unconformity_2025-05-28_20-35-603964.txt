we observe here a model of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
