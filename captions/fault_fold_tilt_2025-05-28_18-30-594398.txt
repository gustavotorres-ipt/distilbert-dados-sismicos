this model depicts a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a structural deformation of a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression with a tilt.
we see here a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with a fold of a tilt.
we observe here a section with a fault with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds.
