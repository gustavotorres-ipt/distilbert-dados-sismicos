we observe here a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation.
this model depicts a sesimic section of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation of a tectonic compression.
we see here a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform.
