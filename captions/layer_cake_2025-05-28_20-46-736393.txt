we see here a sesimic section of a flat bed stratigraphy section.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of an undeformed section.
this image represents a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a model with no structural deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a layer-cake stratigraphy section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a model with no tectonic deformation.
