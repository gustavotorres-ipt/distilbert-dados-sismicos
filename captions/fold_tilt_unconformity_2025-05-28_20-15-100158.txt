this image represents a model of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image represents a section of an antiform with a tilt of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a model with an antiform of a tilt of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
