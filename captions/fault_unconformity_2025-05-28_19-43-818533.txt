this image represents a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a fault of an unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
