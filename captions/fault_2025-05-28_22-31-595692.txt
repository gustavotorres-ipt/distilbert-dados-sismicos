this image represents a seismic image of a dip-slip fault with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault.
we observe here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault.
we observe here a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault.
