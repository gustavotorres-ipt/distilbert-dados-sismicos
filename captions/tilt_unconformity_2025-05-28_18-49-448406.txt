this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
we see here a model of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
