we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression with a tilt with a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section with a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a tectonic compression of a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a section with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
