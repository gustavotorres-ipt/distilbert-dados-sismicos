this image represents a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and medium noise.
