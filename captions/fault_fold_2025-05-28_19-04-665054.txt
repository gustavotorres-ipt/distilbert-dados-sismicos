we observe here a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation.
this image represents a subsurface model of a fault with an antiform with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline.
this image demonstrates a section of high frequency and medium noise.
