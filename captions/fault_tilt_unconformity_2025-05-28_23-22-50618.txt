this image demonstrates a model of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
