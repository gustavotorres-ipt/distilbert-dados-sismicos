we observe here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression with an angular unconformity.
we see here a model of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a section with a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation of an erosional unconformity.
