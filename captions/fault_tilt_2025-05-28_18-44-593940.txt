we see here a section of a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a tectonic deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a model of high frequency and medium noise.
