this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of an anticline with a disconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault with a structural compression with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model of a structural deformation of a folded deformation with a disconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with an unconformity.
this model depicts a section of a fault with a structural compression with an angular unconformity.
