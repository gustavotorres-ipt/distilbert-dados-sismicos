this model depicts a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a model with no structural deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a layer-cake stratigraphy section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a model with no tectonic deformation.
