we observe here a section of a geologic rigid deformation.
this image represents a section with a tectonic deformation of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model of a horizons displacement along fault.
we observe here a model of a dip-slip fault.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a structural deformation.
