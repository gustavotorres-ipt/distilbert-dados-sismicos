we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic fault with a structural compression of a tilt with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
