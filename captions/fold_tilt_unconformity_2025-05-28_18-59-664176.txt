we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a model with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
