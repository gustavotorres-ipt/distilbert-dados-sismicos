this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a tectonic deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a tilt of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tilt with a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
