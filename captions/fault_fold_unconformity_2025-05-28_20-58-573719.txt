this image demonstrates a model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a structural discontinuity with a structural compression of a nonconformity.
we see here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a folded deformation with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of medium frequency and medium noise.
