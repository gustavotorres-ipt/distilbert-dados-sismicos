we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression with a tilt with a disconformity.
this image represents a section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with an antiform of a tilt of an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
