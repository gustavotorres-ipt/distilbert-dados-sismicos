we observe here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of an antiform with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural deformation of a fold with an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation of a ductile deformation of a nonconformity.
