this image represents a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of an angular unconformity.
we see here a model of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation of a nonconformity.
