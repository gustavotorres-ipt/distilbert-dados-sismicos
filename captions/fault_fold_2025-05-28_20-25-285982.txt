we see here a subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression.
we see here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a folded deformation.
