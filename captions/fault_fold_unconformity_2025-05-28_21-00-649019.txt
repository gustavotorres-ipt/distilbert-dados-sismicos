we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline of an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a tectonic deformation with a fold of an unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression with an unconformity.
