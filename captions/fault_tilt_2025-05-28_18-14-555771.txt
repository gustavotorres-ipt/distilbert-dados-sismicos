this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a model of a tectonic fault of a tilt.
we see here a model of a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a model of a structural deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
