this image represents a sesimic section of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a tectonic deformation with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
