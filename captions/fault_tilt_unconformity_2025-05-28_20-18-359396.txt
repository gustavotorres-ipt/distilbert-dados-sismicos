we see here a sesimic section of a structural deformation of a tilt of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a fault with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
