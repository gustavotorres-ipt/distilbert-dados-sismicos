this image demonstrates a sesimic section with an antiform of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
