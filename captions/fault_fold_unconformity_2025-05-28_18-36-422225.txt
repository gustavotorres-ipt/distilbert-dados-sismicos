this image represents a section of a fault of a tectonic compression with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with a fold of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a tectonic fault of an antiform of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation of a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression with a disconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
