this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a structural discontinuity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural discontinuity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a fault.
