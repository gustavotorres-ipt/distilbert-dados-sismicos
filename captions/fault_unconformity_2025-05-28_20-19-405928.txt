we see here a seismic image with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with a fault of a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity with a disconformity.
