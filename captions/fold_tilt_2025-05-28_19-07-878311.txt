we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression with a tilt of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a folded deformation with a tilt.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a structural compression with a tilt with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds.
