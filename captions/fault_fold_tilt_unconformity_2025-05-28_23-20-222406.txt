we see here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural deformation with an anticline of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of high frequency and low noise.
