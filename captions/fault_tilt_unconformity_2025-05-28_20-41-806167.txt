this image represents a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with a tectonic deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic fault of a tilt of a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
