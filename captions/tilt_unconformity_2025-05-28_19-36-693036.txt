we observe here a seismic image of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this model depicts a section with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tilt with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
