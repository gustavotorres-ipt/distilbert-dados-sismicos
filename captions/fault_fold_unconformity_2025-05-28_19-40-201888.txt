this image represents a subsurface representation with low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault with a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression with a disconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural deformation with an anticline of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with an erosional unconformity.
