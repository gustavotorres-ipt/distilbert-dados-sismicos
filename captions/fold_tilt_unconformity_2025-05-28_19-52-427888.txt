this model depicts a 2D section with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section with a fold with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a fold with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
