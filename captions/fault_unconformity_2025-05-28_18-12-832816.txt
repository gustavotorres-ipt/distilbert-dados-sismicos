this image demonstrates a model of a structural discontinuity with a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a disconformity.
we see here a model of a tectonic fault with an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model of a structural discontinuity with a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a disconformity.
