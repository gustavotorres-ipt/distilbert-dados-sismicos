we see here a subsurface representation with a structural compression with a tilt.
we see here a 2D section with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with an antiform with a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
