this model depicts a seismic image of a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
