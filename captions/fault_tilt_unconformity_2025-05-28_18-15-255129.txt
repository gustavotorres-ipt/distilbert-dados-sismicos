this image demonstrates a sesimic section with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
