this image demonstrates a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we observe here a section with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
