this image demonstrates a 2D section with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a tilt with an unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
