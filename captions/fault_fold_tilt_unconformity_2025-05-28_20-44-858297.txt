we see here a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image represents a section with a tectonic deformation of a fold of a tilt of an unconformity.
