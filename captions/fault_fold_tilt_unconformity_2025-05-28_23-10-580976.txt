we see here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a fold of a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of a tilt of an unconformity.
