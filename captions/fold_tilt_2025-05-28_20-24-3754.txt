this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a section with a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural compression with a tilt.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and low noise.
