this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic fault with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of low frequency and medium noise.
