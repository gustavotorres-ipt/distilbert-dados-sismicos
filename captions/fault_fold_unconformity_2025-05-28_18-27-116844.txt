this image demonstrates a sesimic section with medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model with a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of an erosional unconformity.
