we observe here a seismic image of a structural deformation of a folded deformation of a tilt.
we see here a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation with a ductile deformation of a tilt.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with medium frequency and medium noise.
