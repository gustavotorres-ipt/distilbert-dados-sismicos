we observe here a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation of a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation of a disconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression with a disconformity.
