we see here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation.
we see here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a folded deformation.
this image represents a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
