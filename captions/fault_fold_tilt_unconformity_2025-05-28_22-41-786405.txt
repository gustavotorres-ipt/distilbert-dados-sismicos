this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a fault with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural deformation of a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a section with a fault of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a structural deformation of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
