we see here a 2D section with a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold with a tilt with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section with a structural deformation of a tectonic compression of a tilt.
