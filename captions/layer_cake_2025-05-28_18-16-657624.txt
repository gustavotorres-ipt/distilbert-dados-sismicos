this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a layer-cake stratigraphy section.
this model depicts a section of a model with no structural deformation.
this image demonstrates a section of a section with flat horizons with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a flat bed stratigraphy section.
