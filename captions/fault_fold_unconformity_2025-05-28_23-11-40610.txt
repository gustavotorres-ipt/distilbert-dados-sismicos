we see here a sesimic section of a structural deformation with an antiform of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation of a fold of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of a dip-slip fault with a ductile deformation of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a section of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with a nonconformity with high frequency and low noise.
