we observe here a 2D section of a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
