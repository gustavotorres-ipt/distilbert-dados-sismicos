this image demonstrates a sesimic section of an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with an unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
