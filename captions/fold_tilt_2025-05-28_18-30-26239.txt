this image represents a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a model with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a model of a fold of a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
