this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic fault of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a dip-slip fault with an unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a model of a structural deformation with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault of an unconformity.
