we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
