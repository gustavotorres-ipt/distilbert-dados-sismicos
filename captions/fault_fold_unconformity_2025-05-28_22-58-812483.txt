this image demonstrates a 2D section of a structural deformation of a fold of a disconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a structural deformation of an antiform with an angular unconformity with low frequency and low noise.
