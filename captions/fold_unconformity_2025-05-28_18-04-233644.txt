this image demonstrates a subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with an anticline with a nonconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a seismic image of an anticline of a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of an anticline with a disconformity.
this model depicts a section of high frequency and low noise.
