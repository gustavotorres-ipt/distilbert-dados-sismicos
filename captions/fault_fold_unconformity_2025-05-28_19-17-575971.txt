this model depicts a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform with a nonconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with a structural compression of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a fault of a fold with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
