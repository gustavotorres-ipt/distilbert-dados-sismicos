we see here a model with a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
