this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation with an anticline of a tilt of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D section of an anticline of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
