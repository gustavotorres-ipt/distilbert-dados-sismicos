we see here a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with an antiform with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a structural deformation of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a fault of an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
we observe here a model with a structural deformation of a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a tectonic fault of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
