we observe here a section of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a seismic image with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a section with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a section with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a model of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
