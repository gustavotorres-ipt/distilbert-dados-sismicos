we see here a sesimic section with a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this image represents a model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilt of an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilt of a disconformity.
we observe here a model with high frequency and low noise.
