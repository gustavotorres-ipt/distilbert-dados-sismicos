this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation.
this image represents a section with a tectonic fault of an antiform of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section with a geologic rigid deformation with an anticline of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression.
we see here a section with medium frequency and medium noise.
