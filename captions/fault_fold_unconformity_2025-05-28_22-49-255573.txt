we see here a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a fault of a structural compression with an unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a structural deformation of an antiform with an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation with a nonconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
