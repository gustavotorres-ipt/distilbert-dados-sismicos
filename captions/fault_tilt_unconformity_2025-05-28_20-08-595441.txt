we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
we see here a section of a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
this image represents a section with a structural discontinuity with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section of a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
