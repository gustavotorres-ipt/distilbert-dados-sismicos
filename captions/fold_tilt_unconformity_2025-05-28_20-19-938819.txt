this model depicts a 2D section of a fold of a tilt of a disconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic compression with a tilt of a nonconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of an anticline with a tilt with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
