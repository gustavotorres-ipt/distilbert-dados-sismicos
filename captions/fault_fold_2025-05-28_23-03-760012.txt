this image represents a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a structural deformation with a folded deformation.
we see here a section of a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
