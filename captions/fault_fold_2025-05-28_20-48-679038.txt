this model depicts a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a fault with a fold of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation.
