we observe here a model of a tectonic fault of a structural compression with a disconformity.
we observe here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural deformation with a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
we see here a section with a fault with an antiform with a disconformity.
