we observe here a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model of a dip-slip fault of an angular unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic fault of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a model with a rigid deformation known or fault with an erosional unconformity.
