this image represents a model with a tectonic fault of an antiform with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image of a dip-slip fault with an anticline of a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a structural deformation with an anticline of a disconformity.
we see here a section of a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with a fold with an unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of high frequency and high noise.
