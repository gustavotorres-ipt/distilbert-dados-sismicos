this model depicts a section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a structural discontinuity with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
