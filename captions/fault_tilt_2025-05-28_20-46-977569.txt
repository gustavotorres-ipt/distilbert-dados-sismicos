this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a tilt.
