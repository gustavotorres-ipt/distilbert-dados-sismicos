this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform with a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
