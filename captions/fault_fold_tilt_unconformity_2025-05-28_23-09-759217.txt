this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation with a structural compression with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of a fold with a tilt of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation with a fold of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
