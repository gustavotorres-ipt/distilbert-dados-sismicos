we see here a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic fault of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
