we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic compression of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with an anticline of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a structural compression of an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural compression of a nonconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
