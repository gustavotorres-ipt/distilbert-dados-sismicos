we see here a 2D section of a tectonic fault of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
we observe here a model of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tectonic fault of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image represents a model of a structural discontinuity of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
