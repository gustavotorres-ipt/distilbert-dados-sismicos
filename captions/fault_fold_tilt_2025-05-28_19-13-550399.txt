we observe here a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with a tilt.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a sesimic section with medium frequency and low noise.
