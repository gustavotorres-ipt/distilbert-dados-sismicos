we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural deformation with medium frequency and low noise.
