we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression with a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of an antiform of an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of an antiform with an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
