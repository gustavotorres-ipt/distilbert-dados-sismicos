this model depicts a section of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a fault of a structural compression of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a fault with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of an antiform with a tilt of a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and low noise.
