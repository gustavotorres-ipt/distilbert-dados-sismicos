we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic fault with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a fault of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a fault of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
