we see here a subsurface model of a structural deformation with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section of medium frequency and low noise.
