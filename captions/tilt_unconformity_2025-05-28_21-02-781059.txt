this model depicts a subsurface model with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of medium frequency and medium noise.
