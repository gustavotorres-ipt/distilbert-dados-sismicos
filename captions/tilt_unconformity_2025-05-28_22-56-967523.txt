this image represents a section of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D section with an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tilt with a disconformity.
