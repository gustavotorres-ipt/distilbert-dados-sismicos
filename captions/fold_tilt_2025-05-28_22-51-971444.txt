this image demonstrates a section of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression with a tilt with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a section of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds of medium frequency and medium noise.
