we see here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we see here a section with a fault with an anticline of a tilt with a disconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
