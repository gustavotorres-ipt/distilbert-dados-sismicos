we see here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a section of a horizons displacement along fault of a tilt.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a tilt.
we see here a subsurface representation with low frequency and medium noise.
