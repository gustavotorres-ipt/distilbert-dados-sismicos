this model depicts a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a tilt of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a tilt.
this model depicts a model of a tectonic deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and medium noise.
