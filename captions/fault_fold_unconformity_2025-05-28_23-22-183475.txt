this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural deformation of an anticline with an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section with a structural deformation with a tectonic compression with an unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of an anticline with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section with a tectonic fault of an antiform with an angular unconformity.
