this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
