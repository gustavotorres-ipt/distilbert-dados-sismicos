this image represents a seismic image of a fault of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with medium frequency and low noise.
