this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression with an unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a ductile deformation with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with low frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression of a disconformity of low frequency and high noise.
