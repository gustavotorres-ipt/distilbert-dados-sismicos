this image represents a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model of a tectonic fault with a structural compression of an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression of a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a ductile deformation of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
