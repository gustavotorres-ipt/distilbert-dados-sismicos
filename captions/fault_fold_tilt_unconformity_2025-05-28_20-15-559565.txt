we observe here a model of a structural deformation with a fold with an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
