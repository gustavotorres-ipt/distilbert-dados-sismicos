we observe here a section with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a section of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with an antiform with a tilt.
this model depicts a section with low frequency and medium noise.
