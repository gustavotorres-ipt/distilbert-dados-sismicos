this image represents a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a geologic rigid deformation with an unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural deformation with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic deformation with an unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
