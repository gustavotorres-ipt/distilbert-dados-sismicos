this model depicts a model with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a fold of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we see here a section with an antiform of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
