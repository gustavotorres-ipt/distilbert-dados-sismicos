this model depicts a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fault of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a fault with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this model depicts a model of a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a fault with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
