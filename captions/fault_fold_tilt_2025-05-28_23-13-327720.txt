we observe here a subsurface representation with a fault of an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model of medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image of a fault with an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a model with a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation of a tilt.
this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression of a tilt of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
