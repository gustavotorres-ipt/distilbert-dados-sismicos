we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a fold of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a section of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a model with a structural deformation with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression of a tilt with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds.
