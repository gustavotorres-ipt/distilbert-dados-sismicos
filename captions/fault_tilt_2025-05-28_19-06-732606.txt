this model depicts a section of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of a subsurface layer rotation of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting of low frequency and medium noise.
