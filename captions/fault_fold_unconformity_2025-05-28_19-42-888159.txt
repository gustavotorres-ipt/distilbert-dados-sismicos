we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a fold of a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of an antiform with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a fold with a nonconformity.
