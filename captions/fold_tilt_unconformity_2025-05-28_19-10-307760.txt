this image represents a subsurface representation of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression of a tilt of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
