this model depicts a seismic image with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface model of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of medium frequency and high noise.
