this image represents a model with a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
