this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a fault with a tectonic compression with a disconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with an anticline with a disconformity.
this model depicts a model of a horizons displacement along fault of a folded deformation of a disconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic compression of an unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with low frequency and high noise.
