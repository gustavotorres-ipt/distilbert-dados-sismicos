this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a sesimic section of an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
