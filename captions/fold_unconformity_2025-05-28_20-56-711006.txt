this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural compression with a disconformity.
we see here a model with an anticline with a nonconformity.
we observe here a section of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a model with an antiform of a nonconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section with an anticline with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a section of medium frequency and low noise.
