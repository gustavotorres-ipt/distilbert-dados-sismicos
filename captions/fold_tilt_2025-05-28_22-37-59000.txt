this image demonstrates a model with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic compression of a tilt of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a fold of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a section with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
