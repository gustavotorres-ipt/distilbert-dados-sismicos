this image demonstrates a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a structural discontinuity of a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a tectonic fault with an angular unconformity.
we see here a section of a structural discontinuity of a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with low frequency and medium noise.
