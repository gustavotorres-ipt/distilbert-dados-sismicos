we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with an antiform.
this image represents a sesimic section of a fold.
this model depicts a seismic image with a folded deformation.
we observe here a section of a structural compression.
this model depicts a subsurface model of an anticline.
