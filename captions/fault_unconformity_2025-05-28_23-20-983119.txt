this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a fault with a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a tectonic deformation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
