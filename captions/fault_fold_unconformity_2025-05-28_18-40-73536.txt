we observe here a section with a fault of a fold of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation with a disconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation of an unconformity.
