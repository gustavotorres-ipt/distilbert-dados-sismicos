we see here a section with a geologic rigid deformation with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a structural deformation of a ductile deformation with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
