this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section with a tilt of a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
