this image represents a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a section of an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a fold with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a folded deformation of a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a section with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D section with an antiform with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a section with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
