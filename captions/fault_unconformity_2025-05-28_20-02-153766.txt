this model depicts a sesimic section with low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a structural discontinuity with a nonconformity.
we observe here a model of a dip-slip fault with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a disconformity with low frequency and low noise.
