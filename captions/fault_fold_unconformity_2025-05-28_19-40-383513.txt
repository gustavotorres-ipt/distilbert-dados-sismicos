this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a tectonic deformation of an antiform of an unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression with a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
