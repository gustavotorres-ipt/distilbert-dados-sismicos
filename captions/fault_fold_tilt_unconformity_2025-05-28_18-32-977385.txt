we see here a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a model with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
