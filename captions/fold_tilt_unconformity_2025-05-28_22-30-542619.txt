this image represents a seismic image of a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
