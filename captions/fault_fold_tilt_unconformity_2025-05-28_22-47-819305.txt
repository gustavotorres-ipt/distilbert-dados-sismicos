this model depicts a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression of a tilt of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
