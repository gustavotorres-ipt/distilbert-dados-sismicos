we observe here a 2D section with an antiform of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a fold of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
