this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a fold.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a structural deformation of a fold.
we see here a model of a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform.
this model depicts a section of high frequency and medium noise.
