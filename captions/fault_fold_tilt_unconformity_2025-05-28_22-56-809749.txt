we observe here a model with a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a section of a fault with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a structural deformation of an antiform of a tilt of a nonconformity.
