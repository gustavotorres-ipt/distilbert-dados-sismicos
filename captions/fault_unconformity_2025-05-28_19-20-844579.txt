this model depicts a sesimic section of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of an angular unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a model with a horizons displacement along fault with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation of a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a disconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with an angular unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
