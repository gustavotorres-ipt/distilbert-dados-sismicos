we see here a sesimic section with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a fault of a structural compression of a tilt.
we observe here a model of a tectonic fault with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
