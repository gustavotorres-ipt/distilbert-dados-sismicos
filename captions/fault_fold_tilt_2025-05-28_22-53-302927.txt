this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation with an antiform of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with a tilt.
