we see here a model with a structural discontinuity with a tilt with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a model with a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
