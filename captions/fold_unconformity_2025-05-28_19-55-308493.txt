this model depicts a seismic image with a ductile deformation of a nonconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic compression of a disconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with an antiform with a disconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a fold of a disconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with an antiform with an unconformity.
