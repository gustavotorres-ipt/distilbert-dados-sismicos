this image represents a 2D section with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a model with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a model with a structural deformation of a tectonic compression with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression with a nonconformity.
we see here a section with a tectonic fault of an anticline of a nonconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold of a disconformity.
