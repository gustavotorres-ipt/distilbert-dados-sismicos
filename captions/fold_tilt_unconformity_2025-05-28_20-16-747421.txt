this model depicts a sesimic section of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
