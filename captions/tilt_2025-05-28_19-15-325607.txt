this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tilt of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a seismic image with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tilted horizontal beds.
