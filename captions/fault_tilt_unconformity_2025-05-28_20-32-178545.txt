this image represents a section with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
we observe here a model with high frequency and medium noise.
