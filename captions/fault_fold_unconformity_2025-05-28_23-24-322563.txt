this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with an antiform with a disconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault with an anticline of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with medium frequency and high noise.
