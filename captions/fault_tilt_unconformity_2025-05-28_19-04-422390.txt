we observe here a seismic image of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
