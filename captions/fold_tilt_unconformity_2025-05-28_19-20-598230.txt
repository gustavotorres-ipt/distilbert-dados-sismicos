this image demonstrates a 2D section of a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a fold of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a model of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a model with an anticline with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
