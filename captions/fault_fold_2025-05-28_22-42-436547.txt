this model depicts a 2D section of a fault of a tectonic compression of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform.
we see here a subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model of a structural discontinuity of a structural compression of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a fault with a structural compression.
