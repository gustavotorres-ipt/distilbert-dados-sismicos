this image demonstrates a subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this model depicts a model of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
