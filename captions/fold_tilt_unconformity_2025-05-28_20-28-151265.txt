we see here a section of a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section of an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a section with a fold of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a folded deformation of a tilt of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
