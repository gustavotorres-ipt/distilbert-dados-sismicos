we see here a sesimic section with a tilt.
this model depicts a section with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a seismic image of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a 2D section with a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of medium frequency and high noise.
