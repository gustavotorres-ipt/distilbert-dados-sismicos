this model depicts a section with a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of a tilt with a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
