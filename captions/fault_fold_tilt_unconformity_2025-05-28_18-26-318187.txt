we see here a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation of a tilt of a nonconformity.
