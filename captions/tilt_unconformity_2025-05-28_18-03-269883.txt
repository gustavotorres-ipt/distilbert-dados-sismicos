this image represents a model of a tilt with an unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model of a tilt of a disconformity.
we see here a section with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
