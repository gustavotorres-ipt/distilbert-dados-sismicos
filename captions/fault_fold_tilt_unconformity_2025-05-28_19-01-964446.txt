this image demonstrates a seismic image of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a structural deformation with a structural compression with a tilt with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural deformation with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
