this image demonstrates a 2D section with a structural discontinuity with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation.
