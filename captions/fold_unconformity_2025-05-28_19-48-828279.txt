we observe here a 2D subsurface model of an anticline of a disconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tectonic compression with a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic compression with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with a ductile deformation of an unconformity.
