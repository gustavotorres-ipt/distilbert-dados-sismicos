this image represents a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
