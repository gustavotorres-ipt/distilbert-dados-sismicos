this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a structural compression of a tilt of a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
