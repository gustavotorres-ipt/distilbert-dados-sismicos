we see here a seismic image with a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a model of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a fold with a tilt.
this image demonstrates a model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model with low frequency and medium noise.
