this model depicts a section with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a ductile deformation of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a model of an anticline with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
