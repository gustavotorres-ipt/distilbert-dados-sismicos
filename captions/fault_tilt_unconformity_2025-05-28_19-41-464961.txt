we observe here a section with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a tilt with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a structural deformation of a tilt with a nonconformity.
