we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault with a folded deformation of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a structural compression of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a structural compression.
