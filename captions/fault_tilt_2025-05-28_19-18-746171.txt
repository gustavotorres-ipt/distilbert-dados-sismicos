we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of low frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a model of a dip-slip fault with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic tilting of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a model of a geologic rigid deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with low frequency and low noise.
