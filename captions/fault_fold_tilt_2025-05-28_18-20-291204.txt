we see here a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a section of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with an antiform of a tectonic tilting of medium frequency and medium noise.
