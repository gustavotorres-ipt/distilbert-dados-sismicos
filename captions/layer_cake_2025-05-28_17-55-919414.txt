we see here a 2D subsurface model of a flat bed stratigraphy section.
this image represents a section with a model with no tectonic deformation.
this image represents a seismic image of a flat bed stratigraphy section.
this image represents a model with a layer-cake stratigraphy section of high frequency and medium noise.
