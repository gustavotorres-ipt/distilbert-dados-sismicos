we see here a subsurface model of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model of high frequency and high noise.
