this model depicts a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a model with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model of a fault of a ductile deformation of a tilt of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a folded deformation of a tilt.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
