this image represents a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilt of a disconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity with low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
