this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a fault with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we see here a section with a tectonic deformation with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
