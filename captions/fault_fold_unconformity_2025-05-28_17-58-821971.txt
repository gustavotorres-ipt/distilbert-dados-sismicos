we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of a fold of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a fault with a fold of a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of an antiform with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation of an anticline with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of low frequency and medium noise.
