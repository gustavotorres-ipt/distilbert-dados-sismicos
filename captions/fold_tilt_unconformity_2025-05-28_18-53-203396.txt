this image demonstrates a sesimic section with an anticline with a tilt with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model with a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image of a ductile deformation with a tilt with an angular unconformity.
