we observe here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
