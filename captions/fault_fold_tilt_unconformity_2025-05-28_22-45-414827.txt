this image represents a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression with a tilt of an unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section with a structural deformation of a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a fault of an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
