this image represents a section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
we observe here a model with an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
