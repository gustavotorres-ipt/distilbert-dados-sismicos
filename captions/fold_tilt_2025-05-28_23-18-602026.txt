we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a fold of a tilt with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a model of a fold of a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds of medium frequency and low noise.
