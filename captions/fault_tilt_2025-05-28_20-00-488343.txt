this image represents a section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an inclined horizontal beds with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a seismic image of a fault of a tilt.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic tilting.
