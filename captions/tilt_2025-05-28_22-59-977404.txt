this image represents a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tilt of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting of medium frequency and high noise.
