this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of a tilt with an unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
