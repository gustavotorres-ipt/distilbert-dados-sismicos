this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a fault of a tectonic tilting of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with a tilt.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a tilt.
