this image demonstrates a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation with a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a model of a fault with an anticline with an angular unconformity.
