we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
