this model depicts a model of a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression with a tilt with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a tectonic fault with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with a structural compression of a tilt of high frequency and medium noise.
