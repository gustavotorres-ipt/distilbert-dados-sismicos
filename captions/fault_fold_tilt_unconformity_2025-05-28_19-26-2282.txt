we see here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a fault of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a section with medium frequency and medium noise.
