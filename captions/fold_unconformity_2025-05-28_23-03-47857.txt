this model depicts a sesimic section with a fold with an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a folded deformation of a nonconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with an anticline of a nonconformity.
