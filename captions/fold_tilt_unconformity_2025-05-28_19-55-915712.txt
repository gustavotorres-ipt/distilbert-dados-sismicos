this image demonstrates a model with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section with high frequency and medium noise.
