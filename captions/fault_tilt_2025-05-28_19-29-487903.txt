this model depicts a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilt of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a seismic image with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation.
