we see here a subsurface model with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this image represents a model of a tilt of a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
