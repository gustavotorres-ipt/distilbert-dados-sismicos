we see here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with a structural deformation with an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
