this image represents a sesimic section with a fault of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface representation of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
