we observe here a model of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of an anticline of a tilt of a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
