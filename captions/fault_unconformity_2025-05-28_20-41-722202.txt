this image demonstrates a model of a tectonic deformation of a disconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fault of an angular unconformity.
