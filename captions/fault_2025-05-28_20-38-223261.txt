this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic fault.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity.
we see here a section of a fault of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with a horizons displacement along fault.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation.
