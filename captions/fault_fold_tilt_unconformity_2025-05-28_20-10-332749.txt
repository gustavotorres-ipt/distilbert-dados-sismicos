we see here a seismic image with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a folded deformation with a tilt with an unconformity.
we see here a model of a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a fault with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
