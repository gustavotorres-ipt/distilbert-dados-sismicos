this image represents a 2D section of a flat bed stratigraphy section.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a model with no tectonic deformation.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a layer-cake model.
this image represents a sesimic section with a section with flat horizons of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a layer-cake structural model.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a model with no structural deformation.
we see here a subsurface representation of a layer-cake stratigraphy section of medium frequency and medium noise.
