this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation with a tilt of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural deformation with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a section of a structural discontinuity with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
