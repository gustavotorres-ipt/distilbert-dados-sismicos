this model depicts a sesimic section of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic fault with an antiform.
we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform of high frequency and low noise.
