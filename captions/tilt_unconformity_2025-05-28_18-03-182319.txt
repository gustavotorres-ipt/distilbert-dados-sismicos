this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
