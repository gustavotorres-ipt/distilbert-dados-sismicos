we see here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of a structural compression with a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
