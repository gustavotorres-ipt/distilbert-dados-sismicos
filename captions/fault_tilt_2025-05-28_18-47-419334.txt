this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a section of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and high noise.
