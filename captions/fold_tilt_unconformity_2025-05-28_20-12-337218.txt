we see here a sesimic section with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this model depicts a section of a structural compression of a tilt of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with an anticline of a tilt with an unconformity.
we see here a model with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
