we see here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a section of a dip-slip fault of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault of a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline of a tilt of medium frequency and medium noise.
