this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a section of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a model of a structural discontinuity of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a fault with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
