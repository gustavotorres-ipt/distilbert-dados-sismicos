this image demonstrates a 2D section with a structural deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic fault of a tilt.
