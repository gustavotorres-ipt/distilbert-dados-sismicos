we observe here a section of a tectonic deformation of a fold with a tilt with a nonconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a section of a fault of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
