we see here a model of a tectonic compression of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
we observe here a section of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
