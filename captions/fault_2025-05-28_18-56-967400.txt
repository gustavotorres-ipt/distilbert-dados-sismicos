we see here a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault.
this model depicts a 2D section of a tectonic deformation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation.
