we see here a model of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
