we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a tectonic deformation with a nonconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
