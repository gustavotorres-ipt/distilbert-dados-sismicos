this image demonstrates a 2D section with a ductile deformation with a tilt.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural compression of a tilt.
we observe here a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
