we see here a sesimic section with a fault with a tilt.
this model depicts a model with a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a fault of a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a sesimic section of low frequency and high noise.
