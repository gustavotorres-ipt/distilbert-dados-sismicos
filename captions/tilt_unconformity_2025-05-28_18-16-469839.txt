we observe here a subsurface representation of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a tilt of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this image represents a model of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
