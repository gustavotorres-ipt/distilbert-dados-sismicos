we observe here a subsurface model with a ductile deformation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fold with an unconformity.
we see here a model of a structural compression of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a fold of an erosional unconformity.
