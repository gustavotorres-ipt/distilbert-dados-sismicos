we see here a seismic image with a tectonic deformation with a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a dip-slip fault with an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a disconformity.
we see here a section of a horizons displacement along fault of an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of an erosional unconformity.
