we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a tectonic fault with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
