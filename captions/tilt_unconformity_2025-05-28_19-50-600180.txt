we observe here a model with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
