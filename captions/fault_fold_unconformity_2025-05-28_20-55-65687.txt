this image demonstrates a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a model of a fault with a structural compression of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a fault of a fold of an erosional unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with an anticline with a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a disconformity with low frequency and low noise.
