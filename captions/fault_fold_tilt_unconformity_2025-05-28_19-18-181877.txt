we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this image represents a section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
