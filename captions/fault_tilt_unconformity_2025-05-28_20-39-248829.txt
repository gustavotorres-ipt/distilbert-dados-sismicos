this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
