this image represents a subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this model depicts a model of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
