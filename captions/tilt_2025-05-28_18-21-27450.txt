we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a tilt.
this image represents a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and medium noise.
