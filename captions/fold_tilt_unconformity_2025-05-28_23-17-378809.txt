this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with an antiform of a tilt with a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D section of an anticline of a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a tectonic compression with a tilt of an unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
