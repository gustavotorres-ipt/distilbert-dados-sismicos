this model depicts a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
