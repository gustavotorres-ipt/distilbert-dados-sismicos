we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic fault of a fold of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of an anticline with a nonconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression of an unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic fault with a fold with a disconformity of high frequency and low noise.
