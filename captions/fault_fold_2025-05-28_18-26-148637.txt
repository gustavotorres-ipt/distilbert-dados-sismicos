we observe here a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation.
this model depicts a model of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression with medium frequency and medium noise.
