we see here a subsurface representation with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a fold of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of a fold with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
