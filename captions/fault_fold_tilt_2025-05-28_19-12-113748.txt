we see here a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a tectonic fault with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
