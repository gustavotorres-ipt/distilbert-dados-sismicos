we see here a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with a structural deformation with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a fold with a tilt with high frequency and medium noise.
