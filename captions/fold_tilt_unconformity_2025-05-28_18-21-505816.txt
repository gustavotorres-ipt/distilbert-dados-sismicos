this model depicts a subsurface model with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a folded deformation of a tilt with a disconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
