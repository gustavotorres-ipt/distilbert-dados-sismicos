this image represents a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a fault with a tectonic compression of a disconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity.
