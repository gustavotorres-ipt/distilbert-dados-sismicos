this model depicts a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation.
this image represents a model with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of an anticline of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression.
we see here a section with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation.
we observe here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of high frequency and low noise.
