we see here a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
