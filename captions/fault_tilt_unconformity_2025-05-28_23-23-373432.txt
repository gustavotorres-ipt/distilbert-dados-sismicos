this model depicts a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section of a horizons displacement along fault with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
