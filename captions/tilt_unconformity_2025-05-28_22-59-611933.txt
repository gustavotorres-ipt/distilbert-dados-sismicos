this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of a tilt of a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
