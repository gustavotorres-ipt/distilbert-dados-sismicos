this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a seismic image with a tectonic deformation with a tilt with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a section of a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation with high frequency and low noise.
