we see here a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with a dip-slip fault with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of a geologic rigid deformation with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
