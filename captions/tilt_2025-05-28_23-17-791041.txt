we observe here a sesimic section with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and low noise.
