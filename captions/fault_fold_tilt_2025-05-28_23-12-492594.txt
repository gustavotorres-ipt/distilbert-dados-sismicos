we see here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression with a tilt with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform with a tilt of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a model of a structural deformation with a structural compression of a tilt.
we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and low noise.
