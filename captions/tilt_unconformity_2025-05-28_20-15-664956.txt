this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a tilt of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
