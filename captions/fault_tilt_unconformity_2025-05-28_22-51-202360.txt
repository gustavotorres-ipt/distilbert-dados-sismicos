this image represents a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with a tilt of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
