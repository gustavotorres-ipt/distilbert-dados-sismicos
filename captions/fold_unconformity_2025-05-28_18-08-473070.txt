we see here a subsurface representation of a fold with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a ductile deformation with an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a ductile deformation of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of an anticline with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
