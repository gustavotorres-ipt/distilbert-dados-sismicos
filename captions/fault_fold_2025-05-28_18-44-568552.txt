this image demonstrates a section with a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a tectonic fault of a folded deformation of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a folded deformation.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with an antiform of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a seismic image with a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation of high frequency and low noise.
