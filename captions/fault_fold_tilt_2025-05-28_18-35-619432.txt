we observe here a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a tectonic fault of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation with a tilt of high frequency and low noise.
