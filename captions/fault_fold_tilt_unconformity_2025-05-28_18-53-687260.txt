we observe here a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation of a tilt with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault with an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
