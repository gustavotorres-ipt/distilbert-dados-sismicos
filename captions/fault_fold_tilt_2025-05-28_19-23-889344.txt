this image represents a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a seismic image with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a fault of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
