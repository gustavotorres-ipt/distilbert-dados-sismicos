this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a fault of a fold of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
