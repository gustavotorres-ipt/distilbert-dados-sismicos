we see here a subsurface representation of a fault with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of a tilt with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation of a tilt with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a fold of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
