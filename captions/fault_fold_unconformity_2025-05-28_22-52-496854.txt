we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline of a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
