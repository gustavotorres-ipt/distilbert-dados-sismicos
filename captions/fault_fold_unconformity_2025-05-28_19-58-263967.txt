this model depicts a seismic image of a fault with a fold of a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a structural compression with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a tectonic fault of a structural compression with a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation of an erosional unconformity.
