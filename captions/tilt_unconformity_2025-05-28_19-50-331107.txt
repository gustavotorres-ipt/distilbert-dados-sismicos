we see here a model of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a section of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
