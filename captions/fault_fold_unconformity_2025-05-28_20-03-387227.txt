this image demonstrates a model with a tectonic deformation of an antiform with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity of an antiform of an unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model of a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation with a nonconformity.
