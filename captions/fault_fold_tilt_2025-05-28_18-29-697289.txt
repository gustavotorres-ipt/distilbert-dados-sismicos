we see here a section of a dip-slip fault with an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a model with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a model of a structural deformation with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a fault of a structural compression of a tilt.
