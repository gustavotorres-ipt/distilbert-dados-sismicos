this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a seismic image with a tectonic deformation with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and low noise.
