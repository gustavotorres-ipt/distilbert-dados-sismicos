we observe here a model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
