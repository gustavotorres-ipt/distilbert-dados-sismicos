we observe here a subsurface representation with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression of a tilt of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression of a tilt.
this model depicts a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and high noise.
