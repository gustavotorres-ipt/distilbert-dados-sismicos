this image represents a subsurface representation of a fold with a tilt with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a section with a tectonic compression of a tilt.
we observe here a subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D section of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a section with high frequency and high noise.
