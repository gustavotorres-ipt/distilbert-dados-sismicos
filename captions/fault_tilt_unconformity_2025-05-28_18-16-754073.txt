this image represents a model of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
