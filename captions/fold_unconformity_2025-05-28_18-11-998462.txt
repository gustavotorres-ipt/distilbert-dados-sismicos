this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural compression of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a folded deformation of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a section of a ductile deformation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a folded deformation of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity.
