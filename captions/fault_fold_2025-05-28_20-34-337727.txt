this image represents a section with a geologic rigid deformation of a fold.
we observe here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section with low frequency and low noise.
we see here a model with a tectonic deformation with an antiform.
this image represents a seismic image with low frequency and low noise.
