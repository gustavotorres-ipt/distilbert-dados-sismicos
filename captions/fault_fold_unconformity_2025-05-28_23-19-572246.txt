this image represents a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic fault of a structural compression of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
