this image represents a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a tilt.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting.
