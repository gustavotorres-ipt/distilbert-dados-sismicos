this image demonstrates a model of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with an angular unconformity.
we see here a section with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a nonconformity.
we see here a model with a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
