this model depicts a seismic image of a tilt of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
