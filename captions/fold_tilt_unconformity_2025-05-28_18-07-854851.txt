this model depicts a model with an anticline with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of an anticline with a tilt of an angular unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a model of a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tectonic compression of a tilt of a disconformity.
