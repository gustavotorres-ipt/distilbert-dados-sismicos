this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a fault with a tilt with an unconformity.
