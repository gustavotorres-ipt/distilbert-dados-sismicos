this image represents a subsurface model with a structural compression with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a folded deformation with a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fold with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section with a fold of a nonconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a tectonic compression of a disconformity.
