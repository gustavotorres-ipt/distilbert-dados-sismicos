we observe here a section of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural deformation with a structural compression of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of a fault of a ductile deformation of an unconformity.
we see here a model with a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline of an unconformity.
