we observe here a model with a flat bed stratigraphy section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a flat bed stratigraphy section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a layer-cake model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a model with no tectonic deformation.
