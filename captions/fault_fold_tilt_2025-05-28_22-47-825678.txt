this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation with an anticline of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault of a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of a tilt.
