this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural compression of a tilt of an unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a fold of a tilt with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a model of a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
