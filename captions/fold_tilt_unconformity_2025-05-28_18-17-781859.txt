this model depicts a section of an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of an anticline of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a ductile deformation with a tilt with an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
