this model depicts a section of a geologic rigid deformation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a nonconformity.
this image represents a model with a rigid deformation known or fault with an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation of an angular unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a fault of a nonconformity of high frequency and high noise.
