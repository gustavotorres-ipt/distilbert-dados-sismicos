we see here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with low frequency and low noise.
