we see here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of an anticline.
we see here a 2D section of a fault with an antiform.
we see here a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a tectonic compression.
this image demonstrates a model of a tectonic fault of a fold with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a fault with a tectonic compression with high frequency and low noise.
