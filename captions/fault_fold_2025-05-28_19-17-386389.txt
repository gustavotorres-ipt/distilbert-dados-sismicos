we see here a sesimic section with a fault of a tectonic compression of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a dip-slip fault with an antiform with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression.
we see here a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression.
we see here a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline.
