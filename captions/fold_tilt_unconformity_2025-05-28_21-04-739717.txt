this image demonstrates a seismic image of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with medium frequency and high noise.
