we see here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault with a disconformity.
we see here a section with a structural discontinuity with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a fault of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
