we observe here a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a structural discontinuity with a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a model of a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a model with a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
