we observe here a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with a tectonic tilting.
