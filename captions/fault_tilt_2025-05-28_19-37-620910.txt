this model depicts a model with a fault of a tilt of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic tilting with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a dip-slip fault with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a fault of a tilt with low frequency and high noise.
