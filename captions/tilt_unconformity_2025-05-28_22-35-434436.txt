we see here a subsurface model of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image represents a section with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
