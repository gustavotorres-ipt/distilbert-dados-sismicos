we see here a model of a tectonic deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model with a dip-slip fault with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a fault with a tilted horizontal beds.
