this image demonstrates a model with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a horizons displacement along fault with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a fault with a tilt of a disconformity.
