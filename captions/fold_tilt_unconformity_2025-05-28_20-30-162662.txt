we observe here a seismic image of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model with an anticline of a tilt of an unconformity.
