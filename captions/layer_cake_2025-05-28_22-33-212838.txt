this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a layer-cake model of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a flat bed stratigraphy section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a section with flat horizons.
we see here a 2D section of a section with flat horizons.
