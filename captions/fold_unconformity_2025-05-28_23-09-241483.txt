we see here a model of a structural compression of an unconformity.
this model depicts a section of a structural compression with an unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural compression with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of an antiform with a disconformity.
