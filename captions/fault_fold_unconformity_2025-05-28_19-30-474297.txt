we observe here a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold with a disconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
