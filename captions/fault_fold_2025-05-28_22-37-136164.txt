we observe here a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression.
this model depicts a seismic image with a dip-slip fault with an antiform.
this image represents a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a fold.
this image represents a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression.
