this model depicts a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
