this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a fold with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a fault with an antiform of a disconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with low frequency and low noise.
