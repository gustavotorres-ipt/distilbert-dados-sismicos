this image demonstrates a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of a tilt.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic fault of an antiform with a tilt.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
