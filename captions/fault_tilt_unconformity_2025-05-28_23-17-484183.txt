we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a section with a tectonic deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
