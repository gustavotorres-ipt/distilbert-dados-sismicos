we observe here a model with a dip-slip fault with an antiform of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a fault with a fold of a disconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation of an unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
