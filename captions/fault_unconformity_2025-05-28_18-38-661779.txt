this image demonstrates a section of a structural discontinuity of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model with a geologic rigid deformation of a disconformity.
we see here a section with a horizons displacement along fault with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a fault of an angular unconformity.
