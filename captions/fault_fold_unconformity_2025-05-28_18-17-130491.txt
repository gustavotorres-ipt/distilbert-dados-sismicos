we observe here a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of an antiform of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with an antiform of a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of a nonconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a tectonic fault of an anticline with a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and low noise.
