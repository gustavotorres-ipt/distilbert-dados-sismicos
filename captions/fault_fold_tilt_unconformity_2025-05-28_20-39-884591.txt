this image demonstrates a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation with a tilt with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of an antiform of a tilt with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
