we observe here a seismic image of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this model depicts a section with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we see here a section with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
