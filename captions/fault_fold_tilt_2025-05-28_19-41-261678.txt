this image represents a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression with a tilt.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a section with a fault of a structural compression of a tilt.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and low noise.
