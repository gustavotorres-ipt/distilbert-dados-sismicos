this image demonstrates a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model of a tectonic deformation with an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault with a structural compression of a tilt of high frequency and medium noise.
