this image represents a model with an anticline of a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a folded deformation of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural compression of a disconformity.
