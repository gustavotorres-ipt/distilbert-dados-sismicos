this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
