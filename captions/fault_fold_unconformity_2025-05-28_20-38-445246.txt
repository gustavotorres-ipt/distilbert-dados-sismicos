we observe here a subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of an antiform of a disconformity.
this model depicts a model with a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation of a nonconformity.
we observe here a section of a structural deformation of a ductile deformation with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with high frequency and high noise.
