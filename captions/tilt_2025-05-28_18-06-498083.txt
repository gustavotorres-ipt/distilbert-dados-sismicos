this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a subsurface model of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model with a tilt of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of low frequency and high noise.
