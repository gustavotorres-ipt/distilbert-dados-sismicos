this image demonstrates a model of a structural deformation with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic deformation of a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of an antiform of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
