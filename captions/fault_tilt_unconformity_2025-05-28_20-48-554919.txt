we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a section of a tectonic deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
