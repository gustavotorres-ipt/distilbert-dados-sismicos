this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a model with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section with a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and high noise.
