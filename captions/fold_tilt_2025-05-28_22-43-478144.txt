this model depicts a seismic image of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a 2D section with a fold with an inclined horizontal beds.
