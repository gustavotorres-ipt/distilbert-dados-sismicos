we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model of a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
