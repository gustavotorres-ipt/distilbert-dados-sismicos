this image represents a subsurface representation of a structural compression of a tilt of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a tectonic compression of a tilt with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a folded deformation of a tilt of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section with high frequency and medium noise.
