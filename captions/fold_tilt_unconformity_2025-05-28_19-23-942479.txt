this image represents a subsurface model of an anticline of a tilt with a disconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a section of a structural compression of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
