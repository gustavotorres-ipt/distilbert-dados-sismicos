we observe here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a fault of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a model with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilt.
