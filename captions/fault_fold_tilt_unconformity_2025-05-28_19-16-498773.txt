this image represents a model of a fault with a folded deformation of a tilt with a nonconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with an anticline of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline with a tilt of an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
