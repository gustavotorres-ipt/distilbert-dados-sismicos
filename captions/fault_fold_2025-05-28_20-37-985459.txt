this image represents a section with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic deformation with a fold.
this model depicts a model of a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation.
we see here a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a ductile deformation.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
