this model depicts a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of an anticline with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation with an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a structural compression with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural deformation with a fold with an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
