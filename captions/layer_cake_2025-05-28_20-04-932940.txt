this image demonstrates a section of an undeformed section.
this image represents a seismic image of a model with no structural deformation.
we observe here a sesimic section of a flat bed stratigraphy section with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a layer-cake structural model with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a section with flat horizons.
we observe here a sesimic section with a layer-cake structural model.
