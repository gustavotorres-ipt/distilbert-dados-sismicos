we observe here a section with a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a model with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tilt of a nonconformity.
