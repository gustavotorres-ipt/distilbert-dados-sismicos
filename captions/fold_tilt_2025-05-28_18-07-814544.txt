this model depicts a subsurface model of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a folded deformation with a tilt.
