this image demonstrates a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a section of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a fault of an anticline with a tilt with a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a dip-slip fault with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
