this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with low frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a tilt of a disconformity with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
