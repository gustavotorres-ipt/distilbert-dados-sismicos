we observe here a subsurface representation with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
