we observe here a model with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and low noise.
we see here a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with an antiform with a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of low frequency and low noise.
