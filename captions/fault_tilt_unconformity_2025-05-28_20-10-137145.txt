we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a structural deformation with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
