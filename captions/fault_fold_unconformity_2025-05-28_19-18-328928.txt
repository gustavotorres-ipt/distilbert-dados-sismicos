this image represents a section with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
