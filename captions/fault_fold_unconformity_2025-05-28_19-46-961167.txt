we see here a 2D section of a fault of a structural compression with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural deformation with an antiform of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault with an antiform with an angular unconformity.
we see here a section with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and low noise.
