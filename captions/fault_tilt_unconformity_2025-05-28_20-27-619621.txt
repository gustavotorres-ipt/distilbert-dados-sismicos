this model depicts a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a section with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilt of a disconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a structural discontinuity of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
