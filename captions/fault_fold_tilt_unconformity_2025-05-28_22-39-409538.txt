we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural deformation with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a fault of a fold with a tilt with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform with a tilt with an unconformity.
this image represents a section of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
