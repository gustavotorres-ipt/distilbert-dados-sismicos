this image demonstrates a 2D section of a structural deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
