this image represents a subsurface model with a fault of a tilt with a nonconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a fault with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
