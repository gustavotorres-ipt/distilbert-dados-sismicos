this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
