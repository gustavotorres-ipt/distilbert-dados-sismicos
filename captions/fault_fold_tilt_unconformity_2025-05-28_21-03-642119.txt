we see here a section with a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
