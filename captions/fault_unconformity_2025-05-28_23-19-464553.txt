this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
