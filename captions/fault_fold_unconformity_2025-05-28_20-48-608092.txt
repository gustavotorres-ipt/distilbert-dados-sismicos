we see here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a fold of an erosional unconformity with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model with a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline with a nonconformity.
we see here a section of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with low frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a section of a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression with an angular unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
