this image demonstrates a section of a fault of a fold with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a structural compression of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic deformation with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
