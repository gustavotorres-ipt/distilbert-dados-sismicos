we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of an anticline with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fault with an antiform of a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
