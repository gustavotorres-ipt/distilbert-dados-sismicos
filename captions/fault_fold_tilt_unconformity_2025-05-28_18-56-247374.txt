we observe here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a structural deformation of a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
