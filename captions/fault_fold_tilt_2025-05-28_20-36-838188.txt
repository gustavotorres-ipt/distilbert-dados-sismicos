this model depicts a section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation of a tilt of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
