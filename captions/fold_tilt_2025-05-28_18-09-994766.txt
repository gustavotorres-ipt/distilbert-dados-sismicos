we see here a 2D subsurface model with a ductile deformation of a tilt.
we see here a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a fold with a tectonic tilting of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of an anticline with a tilt.
