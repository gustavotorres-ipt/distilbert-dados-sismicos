we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic deformation of a fold.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural deformation of a ductile deformation with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural deformation of a structural compression.
