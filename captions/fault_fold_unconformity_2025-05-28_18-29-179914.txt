we see here a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a model with a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation with a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression of a disconformity.
