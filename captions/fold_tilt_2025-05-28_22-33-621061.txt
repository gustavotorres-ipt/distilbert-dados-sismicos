we see here a 2D section of a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a fold with a tilt.
this image represents a sesimic section of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural compression of a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
