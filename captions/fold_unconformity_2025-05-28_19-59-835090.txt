we see here a seismic image of a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with an anticline with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic compression of a nonconformity.
we observe here a section of a structural compression with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a folded deformation of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a section of an antiform with a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with an antiform of an angular unconformity.
