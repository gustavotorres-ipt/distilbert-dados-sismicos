we see here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a fault with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation of a structural compression with a tilt.
this image demonstrates a model of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation.
