we observe here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a model of a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation of a tilt.
