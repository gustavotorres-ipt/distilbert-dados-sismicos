we observe here a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation with an unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a structural deformation with an anticline of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with a fold of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
