this image represents a section of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with low frequency and low noise.
