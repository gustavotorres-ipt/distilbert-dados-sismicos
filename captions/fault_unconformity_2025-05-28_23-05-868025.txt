this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with a tectonic deformation with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
