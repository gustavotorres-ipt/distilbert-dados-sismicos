this image represents a seismic image with a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tilt.
