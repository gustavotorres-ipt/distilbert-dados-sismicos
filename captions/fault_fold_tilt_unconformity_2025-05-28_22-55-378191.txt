we observe here a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we see here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
