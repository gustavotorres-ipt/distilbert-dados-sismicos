this image demonstrates a section with a model with no tectonic deformation.
we see here a model of a model with no structural deformation with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a model with no tectonic deformation.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a layer-cake stratigraphy section.
this image represents a subsurface model of a model with no structural deformation with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of an undeformed section.
