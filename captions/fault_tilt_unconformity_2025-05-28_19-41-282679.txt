this image represents a model of a dip-slip fault of a tilt with a disconformity with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a fault with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a section with a tectonic fault of a tilt with a disconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity with low frequency and high noise.
