this image represents a seismic image with a fault.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural deformation with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural deformation.
we see here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault.
we observe here a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a structural deformation.
