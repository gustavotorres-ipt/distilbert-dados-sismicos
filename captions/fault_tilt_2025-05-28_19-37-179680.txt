this image represents a 2D section of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a model with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a section of a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and low noise.
