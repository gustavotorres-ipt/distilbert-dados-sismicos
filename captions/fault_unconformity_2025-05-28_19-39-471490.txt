this model depicts a 2D section with a structural deformation of an erosional unconformity with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a nonconformity of low frequency and high noise.
