we observe here a sesimic section with a structural deformation with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a fault with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model of a dip-slip fault of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
