this image represents a seismic image with a fault with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a structural deformation of an anticline of a tilt.
