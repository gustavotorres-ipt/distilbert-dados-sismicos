we see here a model of an anticline of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model of a structural compression with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic compression with a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with an antiform of a disconformity.
