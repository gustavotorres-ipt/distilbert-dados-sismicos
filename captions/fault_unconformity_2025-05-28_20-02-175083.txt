we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a structural deformation with a nonconformity.
