this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a seismic image with a tectonic deformation with a fold of a tilt with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting.
