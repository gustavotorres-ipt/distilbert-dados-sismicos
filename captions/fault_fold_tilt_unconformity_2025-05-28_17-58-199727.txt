we observe here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a geologic rigid deformation with a fold with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a section of high frequency and low noise.
