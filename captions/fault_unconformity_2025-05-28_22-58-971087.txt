this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a structural deformation of a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a section with a dip-slip fault with an angular unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
