this model depicts a sesimic section with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a model with an antiform with a tectonic tilting.
