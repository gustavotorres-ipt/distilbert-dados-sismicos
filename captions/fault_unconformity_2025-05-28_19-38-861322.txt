we see here a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
