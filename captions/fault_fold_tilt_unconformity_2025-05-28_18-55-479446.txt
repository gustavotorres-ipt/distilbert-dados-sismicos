this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section with a fault of a tectonic compression with a tilt with a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
