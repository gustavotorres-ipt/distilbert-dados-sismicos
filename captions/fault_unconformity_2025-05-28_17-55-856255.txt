this image demonstrates a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault of an erosional unconformity.
