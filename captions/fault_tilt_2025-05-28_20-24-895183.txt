this image represents a 2D section with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a tectonic deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault with an inclined horizontal beds.
