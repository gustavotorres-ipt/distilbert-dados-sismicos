we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation.
this image represents a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a fault.
we see here a model with a horizons displacement along fault.
we observe here a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
