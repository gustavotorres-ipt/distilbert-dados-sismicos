this image represents a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
we see here a seismic image of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity of low frequency and high noise.
