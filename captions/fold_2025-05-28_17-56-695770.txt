this model depicts a sesimic section of a folded deformation.
this image represents a model of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a fold.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
