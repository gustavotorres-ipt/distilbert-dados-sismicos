this model depicts a sesimic section of an anticline of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a fold of an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of an anticline of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural compression with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with a folded deformation with a nonconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
