we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural compression with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic compression of a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with an anticline of an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model with a folded deformation with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
