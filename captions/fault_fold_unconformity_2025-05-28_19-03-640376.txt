we see here a 2D subsurface model with a fault with an anticline with a disconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression of an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression of an angular unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
