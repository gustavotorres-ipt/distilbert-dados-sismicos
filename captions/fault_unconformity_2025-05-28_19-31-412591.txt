we see here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with a disconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault with an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with a geologic rigid deformation with an unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a fault with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a nonconformity.
we observe here a section with medium frequency and medium noise.
