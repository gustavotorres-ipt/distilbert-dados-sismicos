we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a structural deformation of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
