this model depicts a seismic image with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
