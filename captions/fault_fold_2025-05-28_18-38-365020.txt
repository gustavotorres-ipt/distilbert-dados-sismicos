this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a fault of a structural compression.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fault with a structural compression.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a fault with an anticline.
we see here a subsurface representation with high frequency and high noise.
