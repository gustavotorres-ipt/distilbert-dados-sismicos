we observe here a model with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
