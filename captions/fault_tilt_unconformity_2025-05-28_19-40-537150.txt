this model depicts a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a model with a fault with a tilt with an unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
