this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with an unconformity.
this image represents a model with a horizons displacement along fault of a nonconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault of an unconformity.
