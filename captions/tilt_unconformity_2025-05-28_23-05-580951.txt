we observe here a subsurface model of a tilt with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
we see here a model of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
