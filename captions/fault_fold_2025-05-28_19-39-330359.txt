we observe here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression.
we see here a seismic image with a tectonic fault of a fold of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of an anticline.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a structural deformation of a structural compression.
this model depicts a sesimic section with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of high frequency and high noise.
