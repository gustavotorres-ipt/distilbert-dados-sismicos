this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a model with a tectonic fault of a fold with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds.
