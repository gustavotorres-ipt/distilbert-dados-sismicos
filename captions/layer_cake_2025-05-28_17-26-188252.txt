this model depicts a sesimic section of a layer-cake model.
this image represents a seismic image with a model with no structural deformation.
we see here a subsurface model of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface model of an undeformed section with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a layer-cake model.
