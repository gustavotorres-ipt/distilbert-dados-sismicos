this model depicts a model of an anticline of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a model with an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
