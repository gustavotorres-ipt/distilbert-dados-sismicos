this image demonstrates a 2D section of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a seismic image with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
