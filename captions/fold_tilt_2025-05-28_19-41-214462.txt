this image represents a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a structural compression with a tilt.
we observe here a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
