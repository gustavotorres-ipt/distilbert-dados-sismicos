this model depicts a subsurface representation with an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface model of an antiform with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a sesimic section of medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a ductile deformation with a tilt.
