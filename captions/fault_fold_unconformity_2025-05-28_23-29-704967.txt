this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a structural compression of a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a structural discontinuity with an anticline of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section with a fault of a structural compression of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
