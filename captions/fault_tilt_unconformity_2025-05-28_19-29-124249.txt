we observe here a section with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
