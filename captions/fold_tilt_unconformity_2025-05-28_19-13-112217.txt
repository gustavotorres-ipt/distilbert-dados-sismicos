we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this image represents a model of an antiform of a tilt with an angular unconformity.
