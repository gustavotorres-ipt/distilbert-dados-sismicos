we see here a model of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
we see here a model of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
