this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of a tilt with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
