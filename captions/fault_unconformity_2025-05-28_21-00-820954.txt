this model depicts a seismic image of a structural deformation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a fault with a nonconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic deformation with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section with a structural discontinuity of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a nonconformity.
