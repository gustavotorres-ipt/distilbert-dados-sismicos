this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a 2D section with a fault with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation.
