we observe here a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a fault with a fold with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a fault of an anticline with a disconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a structural deformation with an antiform with an angular unconformity.
