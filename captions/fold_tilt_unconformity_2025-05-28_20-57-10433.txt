we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression with a tilt with an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of an anticline with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with a fold with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
