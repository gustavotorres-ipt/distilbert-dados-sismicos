this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a fold of an erosional unconformity with low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a fold of a disconformity of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section of a structural compression of an unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of an anticline with a disconformity.
