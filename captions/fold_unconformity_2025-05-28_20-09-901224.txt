we see here a 2D section of an antiform with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural compression of a disconformity.
this model depicts a model of a fold with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a fold of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a folded deformation of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
