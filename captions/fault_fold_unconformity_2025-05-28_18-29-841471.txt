we observe here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold of a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a dip-slip fault of an antiform with a disconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
