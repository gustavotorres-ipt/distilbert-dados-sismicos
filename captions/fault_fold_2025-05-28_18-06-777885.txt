this model depicts a sesimic section of a fault with a folded deformation.
we see here a subsurface model with a fault of an anticline.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression.
we observe here a subsurface representation of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a dip-slip fault with a fold.
