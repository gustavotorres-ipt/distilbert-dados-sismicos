this image represents a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model with a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a section of a structural deformation with an antiform.
we observe here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression.
