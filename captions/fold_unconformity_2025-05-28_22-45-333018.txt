we see here a model with a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with an antiform of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a folded deformation with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with an antiform of a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a fold with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of a structural compression of a nonconformity.
