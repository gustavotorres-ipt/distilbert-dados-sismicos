we observe here a model with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a fault with a folded deformation of a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic fault of a structural compression of an unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of a dip-slip fault with a structural compression with a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural deformation with a structural compression with a disconformity.
