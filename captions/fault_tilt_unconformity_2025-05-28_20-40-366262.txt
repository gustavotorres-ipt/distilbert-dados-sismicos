this image demonstrates a section with a dip-slip fault with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a seismic image with medium frequency and low noise.
