this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation with a tilt with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault with a fold of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
