we observe here a subsurface representation of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
