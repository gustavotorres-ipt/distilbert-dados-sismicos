this model depicts a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity with low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
