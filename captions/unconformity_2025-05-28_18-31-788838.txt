this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a section of an unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
