this image represents a seismic image with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a section of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation.
