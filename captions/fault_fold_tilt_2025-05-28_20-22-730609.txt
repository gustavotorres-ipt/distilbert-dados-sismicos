this image demonstrates a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation with a tilt.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a fault with a tectonic compression with a tilt.
this model depicts a model with a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform of a tectonic tilting.
