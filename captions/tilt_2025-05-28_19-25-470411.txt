this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a seismic image with a tilt.
we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tilted horizontal beds of medium frequency and medium noise.
