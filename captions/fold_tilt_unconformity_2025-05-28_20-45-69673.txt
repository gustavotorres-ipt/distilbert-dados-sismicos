we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
