this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation.
we observe here a model with a tectonic deformation.
we see here a subsurface representation with low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity.
