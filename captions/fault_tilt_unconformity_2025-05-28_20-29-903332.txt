we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a model of a fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a tectonic deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
