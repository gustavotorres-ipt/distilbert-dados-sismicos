this image demonstrates a model of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a fault with a fold of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of a tectonic deformation of a fold.
we see here a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation of high frequency and low noise.
