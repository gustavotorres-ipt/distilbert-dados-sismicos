we see here a model with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a tilt of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
