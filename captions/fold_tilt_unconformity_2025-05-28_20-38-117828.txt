we see here a 2D section with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
