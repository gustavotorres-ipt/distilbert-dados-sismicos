this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression.
we see here a seismic image with a structural deformation of an anticline.
this image demonstrates a section with a geologic rigid deformation of a fold.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with an anticline of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a section with a tectonic fault with an anticline.
