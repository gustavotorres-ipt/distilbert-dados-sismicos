we see here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural compression with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tectonic compression with a disconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of an antiform of a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic compression of an erosional unconformity.
