this image demonstrates a model of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we see here a model with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a tilt with a nonconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
