we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a dip-slip fault with a fold with a tilt with an unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation with a fold of a tilt with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression of a tilt with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
