we see here a seismic image of a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a structural discontinuity with an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
