this image demonstrates a 2D section with a dip-slip fault with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of a nonconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation with an angular unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with high frequency and low noise.
