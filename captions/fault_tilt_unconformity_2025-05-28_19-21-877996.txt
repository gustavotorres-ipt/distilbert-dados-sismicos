this model depicts a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a tilt of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a tilt of an unconformity.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
