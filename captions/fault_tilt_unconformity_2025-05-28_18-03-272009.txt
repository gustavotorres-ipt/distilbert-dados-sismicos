we see here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with a tilt with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this model depicts a section with low frequency and high noise.
