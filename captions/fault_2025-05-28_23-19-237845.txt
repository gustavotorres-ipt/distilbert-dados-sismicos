we see here a model with a dip-slip fault.
this model depicts a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation.
this image represents a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault of medium frequency and low noise.
