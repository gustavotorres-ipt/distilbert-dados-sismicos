this image represents a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with a fold of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation.
we observe here a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of an anticline.
this image represents a subsurface model of a structural deformation with a fold.
