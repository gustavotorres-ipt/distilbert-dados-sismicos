we see here a seismic image of medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a section of a fault with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
we see here a model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tilt of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
