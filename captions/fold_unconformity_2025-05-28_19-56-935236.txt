we observe here a subsurface model with a tectonic compression of a nonconformity with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a ductile deformation with a nonconformity with low frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a tectonic compression with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural compression of an unconformity with low frequency and high noise.
