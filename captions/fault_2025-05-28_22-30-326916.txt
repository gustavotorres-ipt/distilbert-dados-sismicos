this image represents a seismic image with a dip-slip fault.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault.
this image demonstrates a section with a fault with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation.
we observe here a subsurface model with a fault with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault.
