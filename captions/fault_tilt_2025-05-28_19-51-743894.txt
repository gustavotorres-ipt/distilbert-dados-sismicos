this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a fault with a tilt.
