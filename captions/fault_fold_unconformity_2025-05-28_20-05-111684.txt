we see here a 2D section with a fault with a structural compression with a disconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural deformation with a structural compression with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
