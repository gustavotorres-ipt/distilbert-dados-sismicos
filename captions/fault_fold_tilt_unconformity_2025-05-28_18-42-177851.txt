this image demonstrates a model with a structural deformation with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a fault with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a fault of a fold of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
