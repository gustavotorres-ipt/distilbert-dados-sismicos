we see here a 2D section of a tectonic fault.
we observe here a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a dip-slip fault with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation.
we observe here a section of a structural discontinuity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and high noise.
