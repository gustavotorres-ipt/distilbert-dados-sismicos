this model depicts a section with a geologic rigid deformation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with an unconformity.
