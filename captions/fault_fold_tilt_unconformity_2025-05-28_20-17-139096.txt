we see here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a model with a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a section of a dip-slip fault with an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
