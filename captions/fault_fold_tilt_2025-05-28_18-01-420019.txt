we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a section of a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of an anticline of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a seismic image with high frequency and low noise.
