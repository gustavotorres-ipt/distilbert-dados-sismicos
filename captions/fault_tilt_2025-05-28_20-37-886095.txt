this model depicts a model with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a model with a fault of a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
