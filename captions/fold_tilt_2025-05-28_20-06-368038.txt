we see here a subsurface representation of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a section with a fold of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a section with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a section with an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a seismic image with a structural compression of a tilt.
