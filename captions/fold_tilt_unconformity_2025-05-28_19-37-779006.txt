we see here a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a structural compression of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
