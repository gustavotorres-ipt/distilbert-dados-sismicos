we see here a subsurface model with a fault with a ductile deformation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a section of a dip-slip fault with a tectonic compression with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of an antiform with an unconformity.
this model depicts a model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation with an angular unconformity.
