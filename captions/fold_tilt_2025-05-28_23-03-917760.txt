this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a subsurface model with a structural compression of a tilt.
this image represents a seismic image of a fold with a tilt with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
