we see here a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic compression of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a fault of a structural compression.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a ductile deformation.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a fault of a fold of medium frequency and medium noise.
