we see here a subsurface representation with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
we see here a section with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic compression with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
