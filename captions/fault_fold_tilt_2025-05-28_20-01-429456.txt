we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a fault of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation with a tilt.
we see here a model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold of a tilt.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
