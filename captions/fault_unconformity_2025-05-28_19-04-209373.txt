this model depicts a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of an erosional unconformity.
