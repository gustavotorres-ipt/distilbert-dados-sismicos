we observe here a subsurface representation with an antiform with a tilt with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression with a tilt with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a structural compression with a tilt with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of a fold of a tilt of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
