this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section with an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
