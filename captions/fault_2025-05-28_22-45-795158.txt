this model depicts a section with a structural deformation.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with low frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation.
we see here a sesimic section with low frequency and low noise.
