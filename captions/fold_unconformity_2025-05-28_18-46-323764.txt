we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a folded deformation with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural compression of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a ductile deformation with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
