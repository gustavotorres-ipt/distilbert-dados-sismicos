we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
we see here a seismic image with high frequency and high noise.
