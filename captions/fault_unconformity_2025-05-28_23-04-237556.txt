this image represents a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a nonconformity.
we observe here a section of a fault with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
