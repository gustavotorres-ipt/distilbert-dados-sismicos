this image demonstrates a section with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a flat bed stratigraphy section.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a layer-cake model.
we see here a subsurface representation of a model with no structural deformation.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with an undeformed section.
