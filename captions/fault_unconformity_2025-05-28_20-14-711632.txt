we see here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a model of a horizons displacement along fault of an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault with an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a structural deformation of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
