this image represents a model with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a model with medium frequency and high noise.
