this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation with a disconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fault of an anticline with a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a folded deformation with an unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of a fold of a nonconformity.
