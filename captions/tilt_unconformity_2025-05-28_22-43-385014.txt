we see here a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tilt of an unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
