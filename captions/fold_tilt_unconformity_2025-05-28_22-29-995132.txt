this model depicts a model of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a section of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with an antiform of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
