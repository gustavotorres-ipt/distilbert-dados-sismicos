we observe here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation with an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of an anticline with an angular unconformity.
