we observe here a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with a tectonic fault of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
