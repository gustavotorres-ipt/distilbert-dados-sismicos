we see here a subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
