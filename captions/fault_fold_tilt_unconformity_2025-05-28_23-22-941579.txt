this image demonstrates a sesimic section with low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with low frequency and low noise.
we see here a model with a tectonic fault of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
we observe here a model with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
