this image represents a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a fault of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
