this image demonstrates a sesimic section of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this model depicts a section with a ductile deformation with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
