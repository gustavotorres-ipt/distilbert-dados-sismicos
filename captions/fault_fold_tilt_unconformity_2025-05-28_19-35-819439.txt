we observe here a model of a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section with a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
