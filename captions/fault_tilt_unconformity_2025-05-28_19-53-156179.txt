this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a fault of a tilt of an angular unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a section with a structural deformation with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a tilt with an erosional unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
