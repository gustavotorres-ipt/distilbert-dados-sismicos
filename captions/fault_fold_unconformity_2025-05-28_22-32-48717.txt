we see here a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a fault of a fold with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a section with a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with medium frequency and high noise.
