this model depicts a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a model with a horizons displacement along fault with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of an unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
