this image represents a section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a model with a horizons displacement along fault of a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with a fold of a tectonic tilting.
