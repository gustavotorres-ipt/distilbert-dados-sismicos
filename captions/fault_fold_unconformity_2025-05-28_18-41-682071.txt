we observe here a section of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression of an unconformity.
we see here a section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section with a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation of an unconformity.
