this model depicts a sesimic section with medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a fault with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
