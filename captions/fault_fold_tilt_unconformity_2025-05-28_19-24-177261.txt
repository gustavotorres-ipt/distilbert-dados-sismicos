we see here a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this model depicts a model with a fault of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity of low frequency and low noise.
