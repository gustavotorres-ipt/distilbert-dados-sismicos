we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural deformation with a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with a fold of a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression with an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a structural deformation of a folded deformation with an erosional unconformity.
