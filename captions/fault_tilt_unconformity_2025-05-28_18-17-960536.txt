we observe here a model of a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic fault of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with high frequency and low noise.
