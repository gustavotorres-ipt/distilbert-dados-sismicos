we observe here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model with a dip-slip fault of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a tectonic deformation with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
