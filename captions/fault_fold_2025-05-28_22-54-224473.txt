this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression.
we see here a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault with a fold.
we see here a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform.
