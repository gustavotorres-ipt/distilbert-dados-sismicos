we see here a subsurface model of a model with no tectonic deformation.
this image represents a seismic image of an undeformed section.
this image represents a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a model with no structural deformation of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a flat bed stratigraphy section.
