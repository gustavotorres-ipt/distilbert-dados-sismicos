we observe here a seismic image with an antiform of a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a structural compression of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a section with an anticline with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
