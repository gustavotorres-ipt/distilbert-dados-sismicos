this image demonstrates a seismic image with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation with a tilt.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of an anticline of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a section with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation with a tilt with low frequency and medium noise.
