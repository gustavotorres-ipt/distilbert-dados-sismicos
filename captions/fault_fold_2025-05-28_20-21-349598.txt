we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a fold.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a fault of a tectonic compression.
this image represents a model with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a fault of a ductile deformation.
this model depicts a model of a tectonic fault with a folded deformation with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of medium frequency and low noise.
