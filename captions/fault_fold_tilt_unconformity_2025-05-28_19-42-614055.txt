we see here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a dip-slip fault with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of a fold of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
