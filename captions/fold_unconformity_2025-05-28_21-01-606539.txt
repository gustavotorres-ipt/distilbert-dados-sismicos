we observe here a subsurface model with a fold of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of an anticline of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural compression with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic compression of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
