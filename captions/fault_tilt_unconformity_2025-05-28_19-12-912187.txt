we observe here a model of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
