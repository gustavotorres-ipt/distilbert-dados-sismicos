we see here a seismic image of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural deformation of a tectonic compression with a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of low frequency and high noise.
