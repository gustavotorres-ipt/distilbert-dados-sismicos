we see here a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of a structural compression with a tilt.
this image represents a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural deformation with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
