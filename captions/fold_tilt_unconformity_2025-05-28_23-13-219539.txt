this image represents a 2D section of a folded deformation of a tilt of a disconformity.
we see here a model of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a model with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with an anticline of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a model with high frequency and low noise.
