this image demonstrates a model with a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression of a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a fold of an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a model with a fault with a fold with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with an anticline of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and high noise.
