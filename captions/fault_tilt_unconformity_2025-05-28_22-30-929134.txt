this image represents a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a fault with a tilt of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
