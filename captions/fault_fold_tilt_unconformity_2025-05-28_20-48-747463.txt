we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a section of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a section of a tectonic deformation with an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
