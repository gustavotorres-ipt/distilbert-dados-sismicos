this model depicts a sesimic section of a folded deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a structural compression with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with an antiform with a disconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a tectonic compression of an unconformity.
we observe here a model of a structural compression of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a ductile deformation with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
