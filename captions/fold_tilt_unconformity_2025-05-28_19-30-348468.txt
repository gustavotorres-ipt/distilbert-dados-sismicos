we observe here a section with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
