we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault with a tilt.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a tilt of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a subsurface layer rotation of high frequency and medium noise.
