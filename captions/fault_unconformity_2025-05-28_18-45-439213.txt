this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a structural deformation of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with high frequency and medium noise.
