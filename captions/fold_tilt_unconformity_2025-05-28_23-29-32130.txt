we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fold with a tilt of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a tectonic compression of a tilt of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
