we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a fault of a folded deformation with a tilt of a disconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this image represents a section with a tectonic deformation with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
