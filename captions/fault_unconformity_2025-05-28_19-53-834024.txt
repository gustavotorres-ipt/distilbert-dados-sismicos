we see here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault of a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
