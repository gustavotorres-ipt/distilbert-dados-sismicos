we see here a section with a structural deformation of a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression with a tilt with an unconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a fault with a tectonic compression with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a section of a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a fault of a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
