we see here a section of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a tectonic fault with a fold of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a section of a structural discontinuity of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
