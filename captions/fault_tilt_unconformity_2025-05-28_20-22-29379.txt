we observe here a model with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a model of a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this image represents a model of low frequency and high noise.
