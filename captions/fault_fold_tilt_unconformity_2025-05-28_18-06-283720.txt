this image represents a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with an anticline with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
