we observe here a section with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a section with a fault with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity of a tilt with an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a model with a structural deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
