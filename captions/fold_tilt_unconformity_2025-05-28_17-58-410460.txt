this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of an antiform of a tilt with a nonconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression with a tilt with a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
