this image demonstrates a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a model of a geologic rigid deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of low frequency and medium noise.
