we see here a model of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
we observe here a model with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a section with a tilt of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
