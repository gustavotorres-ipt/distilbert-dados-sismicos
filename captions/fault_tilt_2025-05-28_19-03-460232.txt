this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic tilting.
