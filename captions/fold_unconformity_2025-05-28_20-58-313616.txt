this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model of a tectonic compression with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic compression with an unconformity.
we observe here a model of a folded deformation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a structural compression of a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of an antiform with an angular unconformity.
