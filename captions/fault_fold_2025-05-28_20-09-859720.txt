this model depicts a model with a fault of an antiform.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural deformation with a fold.
this model depicts a 2D section with a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a fault of a tectonic compression of medium frequency and medium noise.
