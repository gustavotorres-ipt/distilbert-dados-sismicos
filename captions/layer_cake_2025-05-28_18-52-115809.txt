this image demonstrates a subsurface model with low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a model with no tectonic deformation.
we see here a seismic image of a section with flat horizons.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a layer-cake stratigraphy section of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a layer-cake model.
