we see here a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a 2D section with low frequency and medium noise.
