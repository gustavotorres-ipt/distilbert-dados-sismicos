we observe here a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
