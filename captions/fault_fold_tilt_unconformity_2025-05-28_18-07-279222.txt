we see here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a fault of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
we see here a section of a tectonic fault of an antiform with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
