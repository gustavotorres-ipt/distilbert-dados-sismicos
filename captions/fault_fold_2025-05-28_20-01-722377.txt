this model depicts a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a structural deformation with a structural compression.
we see here a subsurface representation with a fault of an antiform.
