this model depicts a section of a tectonic fault with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
