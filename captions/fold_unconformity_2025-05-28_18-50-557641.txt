this image demonstrates a model with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a structural compression of a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with an antiform with an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a ductile deformation of a nonconformity.
