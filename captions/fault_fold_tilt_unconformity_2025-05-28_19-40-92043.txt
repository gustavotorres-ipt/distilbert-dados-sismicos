we observe here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a model with a structural discontinuity with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a model of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
