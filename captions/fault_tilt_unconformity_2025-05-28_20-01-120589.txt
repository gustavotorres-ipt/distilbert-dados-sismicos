this model depicts a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilt of a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
we see here a section with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a tilt with an unconformity.
