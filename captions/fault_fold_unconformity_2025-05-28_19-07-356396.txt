this image demonstrates a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a folded deformation with an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a tectonic deformation of an antiform of an unconformity.
