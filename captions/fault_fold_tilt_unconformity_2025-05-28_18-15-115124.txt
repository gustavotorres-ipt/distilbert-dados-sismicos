this model depicts a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural deformation of an antiform with a tilt of an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation with a tilt with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
