we observe here a seismic image of a fold of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a ductile deformation of a nonconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a structural compression with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of an antiform with an angular unconformity.
