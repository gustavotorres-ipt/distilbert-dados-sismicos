we observe here a subsurface representation with a fold with a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a folded deformation of a tilt of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with an antiform with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with an antiform of a tilt of a disconformity.
