we observe here a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a fault of a fold.
this image represents a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a structural deformation with an anticline.
we see here a model of a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic compression.
we see here a section of a structural deformation of a fold of medium frequency and high noise.
