this model depicts a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of an antiform of a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with a fault with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds.
