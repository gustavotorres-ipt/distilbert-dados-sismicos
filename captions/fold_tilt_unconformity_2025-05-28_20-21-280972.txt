we see here a subsurface model with a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of an antiform with a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
