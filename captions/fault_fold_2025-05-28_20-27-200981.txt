this model depicts a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with an anticline.
we see here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation.
we see here a sesimic section with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a folded deformation with low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a dip-slip fault of a structural compression.
this image represents a seismic image of low frequency and medium noise.
