we observe here a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a subsurface model with low frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a seismic image with low frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural deformation with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds of low frequency and high noise.
