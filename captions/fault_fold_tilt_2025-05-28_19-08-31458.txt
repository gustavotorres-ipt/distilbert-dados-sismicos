this image demonstrates a model with a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a model with a structural discontinuity of a structural compression of a tilt.
we see here a subsurface model with a structural deformation with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a sesimic section of low frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a fault of a folded deformation of a tilt.
