this image represents a subsurface model with a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
