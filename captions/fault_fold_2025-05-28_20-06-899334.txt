this image demonstrates a model of a fault with a folded deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation.
we observe here a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with an anticline with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an anticline.
this image demonstrates a section with a geologic rigid deformation with a fold.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of a structural compression of medium frequency and medium noise.
