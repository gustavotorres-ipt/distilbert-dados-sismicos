we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of a fold with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with an antiform of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
