this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
