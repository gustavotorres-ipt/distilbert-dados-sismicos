we see here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section with a fault with a tectonic compression of a tilt.
this image represents a section of a horizons displacement along fault with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
