this image represents a model of a fault with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this model depicts a section with a fault with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic compression of a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
