this image represents a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
this image represents a section with a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
