we observe here a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a tilt.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a section of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a model with a tectonic fault of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image represents a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation with low frequency and low noise.
