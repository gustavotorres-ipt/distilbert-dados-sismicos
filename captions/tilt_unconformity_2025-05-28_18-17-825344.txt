this model depicts a sesimic section with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
