this model depicts a section of a dip-slip fault with an anticline of a tilt.
we observe here a model with a structural discontinuity of a tectonic compression with a tilt of low frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of low frequency and high noise.
