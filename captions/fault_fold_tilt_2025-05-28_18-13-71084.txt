this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault with a ductile deformation with a tilt.
we observe here a model with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a tilt.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of an antiform of a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a model of a fault of a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
