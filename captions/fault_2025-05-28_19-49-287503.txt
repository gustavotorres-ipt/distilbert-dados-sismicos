this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a fault.
we see here a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault.
this image represents a seismic image with a tectonic deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
