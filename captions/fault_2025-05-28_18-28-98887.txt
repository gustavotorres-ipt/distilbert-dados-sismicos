we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation.
