we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic fault with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a geologic rigid deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a section of a structural deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with low frequency and medium noise.
