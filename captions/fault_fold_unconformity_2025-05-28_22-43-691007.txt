this image demonstrates a 2D section with a tectonic deformation with an antiform with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation with a fold of a disconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a model of a tectonic deformation with an antiform of an angular unconformity.
