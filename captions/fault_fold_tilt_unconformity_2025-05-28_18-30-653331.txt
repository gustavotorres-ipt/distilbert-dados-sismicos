this image represents a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a section with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation of a tilt with a disconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation of a tilt with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a seismic image with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
