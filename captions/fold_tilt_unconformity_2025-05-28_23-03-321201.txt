we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a model of an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a model with an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
