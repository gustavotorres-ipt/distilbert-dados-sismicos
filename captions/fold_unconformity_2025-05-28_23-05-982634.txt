this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a section of an anticline with an unconformity.
we see here a section of a fold with an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a fold with an unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model with a ductile deformation of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
