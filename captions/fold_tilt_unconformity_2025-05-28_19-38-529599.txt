this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a tectonic compression with a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of an antiform with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a folded deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
