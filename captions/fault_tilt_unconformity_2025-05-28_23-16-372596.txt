this model depicts a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a tilt of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a fault with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a tilt of an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
