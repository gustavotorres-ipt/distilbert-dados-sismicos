we see here a section with a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
