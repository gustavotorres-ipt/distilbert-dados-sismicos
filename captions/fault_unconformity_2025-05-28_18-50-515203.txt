we see here a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity of an unconformity.
this model depicts a section of a fault with an angular unconformity.
we see here a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with an erosional unconformity with low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation of an unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault of an unconformity of low frequency and low noise.
