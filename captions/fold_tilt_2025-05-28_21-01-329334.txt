this image represents a subsurface representation of a structural compression with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a model with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a seismic image with a fold of an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a section with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a subsurface model with an antiform of an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
