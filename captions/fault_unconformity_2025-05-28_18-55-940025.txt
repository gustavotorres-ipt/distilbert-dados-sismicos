this image demonstrates a model of a structural discontinuity of an angular unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation with a nonconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a rigid deformation known or fault with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a dip-slip fault of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural deformation of an unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
