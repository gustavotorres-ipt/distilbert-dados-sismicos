we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault with a folded deformation of an unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation of a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform of a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a structural discontinuity with an anticline of a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of a tectonic deformation of a structural compression with a nonconformity with high frequency and high noise.
