we observe here a subsurface representation of an anticline with a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
we see here a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
