this image represents a model with a structural deformation of an antiform of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
we observe here a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with a structural compression of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation of an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of high frequency and medium noise.
