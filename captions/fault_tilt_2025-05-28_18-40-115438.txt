this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a fault of an inclined horizontal beds with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a structural deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tilt with low frequency and medium noise.
