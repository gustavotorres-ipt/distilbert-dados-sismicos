we see here a sesimic section of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with medium frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a section of a fold of a tectonic tilting of an erosional unconformity.
