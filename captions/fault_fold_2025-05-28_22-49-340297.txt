this image represents a 2D section of a structural deformation of a fold.
this model depicts a subsurface model of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation of an antiform.
we see here a 2D section of a fault of a fold.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation.
this image represents a 2D section with a structural discontinuity of an antiform of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface model with high frequency and low noise.
