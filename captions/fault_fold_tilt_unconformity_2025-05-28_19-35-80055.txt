this image represents a section of a tectonic fault of a fold with a tilt with a disconformity.
we observe here a 2D section with a tectonic fault of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation with a folded deformation of a tilt with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
