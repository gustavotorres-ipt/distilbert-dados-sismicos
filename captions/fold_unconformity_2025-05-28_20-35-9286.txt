we see here a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a fold of a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a folded deformation of an unconformity.
we observe here a section of a structural compression with a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with an antiform with an unconformity.
