we observe here a sesimic section with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
we observe here a model with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a model with a fold with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of an anticline of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
