this model depicts a subsurface representation with an anticline of a tectonic tilting of a nonconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with an anticline of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a structural compression with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
