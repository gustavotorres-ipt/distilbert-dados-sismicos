we see here a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault of a fold of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a geologic rigid deformation with a fold.
