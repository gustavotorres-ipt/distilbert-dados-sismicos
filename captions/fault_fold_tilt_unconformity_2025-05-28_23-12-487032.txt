this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with low frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section with a fault with an antiform of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
