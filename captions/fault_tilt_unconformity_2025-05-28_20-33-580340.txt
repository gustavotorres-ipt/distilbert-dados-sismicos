we see here a model with a dip-slip fault with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this model depicts a model with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a section of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a fault with a tilt of a nonconformity.
we observe here a section of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
