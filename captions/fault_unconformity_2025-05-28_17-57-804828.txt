this image represents a section with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a structural deformation with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic fault with an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation with a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a dip-slip fault of a disconformity.
