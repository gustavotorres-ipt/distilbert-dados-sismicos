this image demonstrates a model of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of an anticline of a tilt with an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a fold with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with an antiform of a tilt of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
