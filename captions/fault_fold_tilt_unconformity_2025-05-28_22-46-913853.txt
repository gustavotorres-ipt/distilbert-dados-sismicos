we see here a subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a geologic rigid deformation with a ductile deformation with a tilt with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity.
