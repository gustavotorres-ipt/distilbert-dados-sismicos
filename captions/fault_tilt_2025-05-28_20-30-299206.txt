this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a tectonic tilting.
this image represents a section of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section with a tectonic fault with a subsurface layer rotation with low frequency and medium noise.
