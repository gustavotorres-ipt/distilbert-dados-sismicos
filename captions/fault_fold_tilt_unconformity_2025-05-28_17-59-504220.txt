this image demonstrates a sesimic section of high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a section of a tectonic fault with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a tectonic deformation of a structural compression of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a seismic image with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
