we observe here a model of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic compression of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic fault with a folded deformation with an unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a fold with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic compression with a nonconformity.
