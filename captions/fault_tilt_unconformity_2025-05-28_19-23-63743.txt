we observe here a model with a geologic rigid deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a seismic image with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a tectonic tilting with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
