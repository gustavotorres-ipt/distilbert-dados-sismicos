we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault of an antiform with an unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with an anticline with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of low frequency and medium noise.
