we observe here a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a tectonic deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a fault with a tilt of medium frequency and medium noise.
