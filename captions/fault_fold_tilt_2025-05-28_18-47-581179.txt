this image represents a 2D section of a structural discontinuity of a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image represents a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a model of a fault of a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a dip-slip fault with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a section with a structural discontinuity of a structural compression of a subsurface layer rotation.
