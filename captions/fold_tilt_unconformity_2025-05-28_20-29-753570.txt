this image demonstrates a section with an anticline of a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
