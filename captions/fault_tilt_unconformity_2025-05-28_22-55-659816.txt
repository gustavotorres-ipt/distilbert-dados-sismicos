we observe here a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a section with a fault with a tilt of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a fault of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
