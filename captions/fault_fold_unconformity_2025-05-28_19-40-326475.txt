we see here a model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural deformation with a structural compression with an angular unconformity.
we see here a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a structural deformation of a ductile deformation with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a structural deformation with a structural compression with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
