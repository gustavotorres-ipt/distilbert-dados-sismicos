we see here a 2D subsurface model of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model of a tilt of an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section with a tilt with a nonconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
