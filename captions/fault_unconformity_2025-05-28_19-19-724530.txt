this image demonstrates a section of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with an unconformity with low frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of low frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a horizons displacement along fault of a nonconformity with low frequency and high noise.
