we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of a structural deformation of a structural compression with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural deformation of an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with an antiform of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
