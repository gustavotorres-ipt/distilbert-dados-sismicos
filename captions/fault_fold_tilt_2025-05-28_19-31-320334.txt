this image represents a subsurface representation with a fault of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression with a tilt with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a model of high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation.
