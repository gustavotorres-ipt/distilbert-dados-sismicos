we see here a subsurface model of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a tilted horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation of a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
