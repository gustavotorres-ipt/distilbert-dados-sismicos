this image represents a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this image represents a seismic image of an anticline with a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
