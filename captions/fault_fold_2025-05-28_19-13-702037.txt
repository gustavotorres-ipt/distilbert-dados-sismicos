this model depicts a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault with a ductile deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a fold.
we see here a subsurface representation with a rigid deformation known or fault with an antiform of medium frequency and medium noise.
