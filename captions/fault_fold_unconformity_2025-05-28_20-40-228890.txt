we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of an antiform with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a tectonic fault of a folded deformation of an angular unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image with a fault with an anticline with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
