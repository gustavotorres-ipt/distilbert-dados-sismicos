we see here a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with high frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression of a tilt with high frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault with a structural compression of a tectonic tilting.
