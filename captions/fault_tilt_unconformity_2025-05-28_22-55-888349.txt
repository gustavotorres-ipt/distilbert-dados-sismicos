we observe here a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model of a fault with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a sesimic section with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic tilting of an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
