we see here a seismic image of a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of high frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic deformation of a tilt with a disconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
we see here a section of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a horizons displacement along fault with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
