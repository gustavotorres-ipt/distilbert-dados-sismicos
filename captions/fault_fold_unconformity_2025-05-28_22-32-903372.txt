this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a fold with a nonconformity.
we observe here a section with a fault with a structural compression of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface model of a fault of an antiform with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform of a nonconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault with an antiform of an erosional unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with medium frequency and high noise.
