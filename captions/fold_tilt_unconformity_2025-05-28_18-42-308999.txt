this image represents a sesimic section of a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a ductile deformation with a tilt of an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
