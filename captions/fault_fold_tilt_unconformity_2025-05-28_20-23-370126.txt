this image represents a 2D section with a structural deformation with a folded deformation of a tilt of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a subsurface representation of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic fault with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic compression with a tilt of an erosional unconformity.
