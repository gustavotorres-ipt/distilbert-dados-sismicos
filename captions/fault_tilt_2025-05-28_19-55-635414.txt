this model depicts a section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic tilting of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a horizons displacement along fault of an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a model with high frequency and medium noise.
