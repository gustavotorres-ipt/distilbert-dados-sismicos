this model depicts a model of a fault of a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with a tilt.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation.
we observe here a subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting.
