this image represents a section with a fault of a tectonic compression of a tilt.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a folded deformation of a tectonic tilting.
this model depicts a section with low frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a structural deformation of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression with a tilt of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of low frequency and medium noise.
