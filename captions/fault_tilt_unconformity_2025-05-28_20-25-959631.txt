we see here a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
