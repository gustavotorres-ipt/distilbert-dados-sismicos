we observe here a sesimic section with a layer-cake model.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a model with no tectonic deformation.
this model depicts a model with an undeformed section with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with a flat bed stratigraphy section of medium frequency and high noise.
we see here a subsurface model with a layer-cake structural model.
