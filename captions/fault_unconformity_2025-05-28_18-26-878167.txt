we see here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a geologic rigid deformation with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic deformation of an angular unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section with high frequency and medium noise.
