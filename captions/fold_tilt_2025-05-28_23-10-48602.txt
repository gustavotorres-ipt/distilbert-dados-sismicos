we observe here a 2D section with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting with low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a fold with a subsurface layer rotation.
