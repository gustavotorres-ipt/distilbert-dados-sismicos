this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a tilted horizontal beds of a disconformity.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a tilt with an angular unconformity.
