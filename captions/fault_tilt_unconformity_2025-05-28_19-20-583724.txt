we see here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
