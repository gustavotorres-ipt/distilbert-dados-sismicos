we observe here a section of medium frequency and low noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of a folded deformation with a disconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a fold with an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
