we see here a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with a tectonic compression.
we see here a subsurface model with a structural discontinuity of a folded deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of an anticline.
we see here a subsurface representation of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tectonic fault with an antiform.
this image represents a section with a geologic rigid deformation with a ductile deformation of medium frequency and medium noise.
