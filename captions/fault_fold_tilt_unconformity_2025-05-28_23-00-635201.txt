this model depicts a 2D section of a tectonic deformation with a folded deformation with a tilt with an erosional unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D section with a structural deformation with a tectonic compression of a tilt with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a fold of a tilt of a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic fault of an antiform with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation with an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
