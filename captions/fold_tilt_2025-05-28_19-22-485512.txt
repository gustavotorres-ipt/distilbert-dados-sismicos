this model depicts a sesimic section with an antiform with a tilted horizontal beds with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a tectonic compression of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with an antiform of a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a 2D section with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation with a tilt of high frequency and high noise.
