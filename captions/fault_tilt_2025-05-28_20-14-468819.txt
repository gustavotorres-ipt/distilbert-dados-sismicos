this image represents a section of a geologic rigid deformation of a tilt.
this model depicts a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilt with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a tectonic fault with a tilt.
we see here a 2D section with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a structural deformation of a tectonic tilting with medium frequency and medium noise.
