we see here a seismic image of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a tilt with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
