we observe here a sesimic section with a geologic rigid deformation of a fold.
this image demonstrates a section with high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault of a fold with high frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a structural deformation with a fold.
