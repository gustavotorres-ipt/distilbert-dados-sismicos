we observe here a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a ductile deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
we see here a subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a structural compression of an inclined horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this image represents a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with a fold with a tilt of a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a fold of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity with low frequency and low noise.
