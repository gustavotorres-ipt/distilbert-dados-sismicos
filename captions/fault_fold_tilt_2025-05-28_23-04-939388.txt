this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a fault of a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds of high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic fault of a ductile deformation of an inclined horizontal beds with high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tectonic deformation of a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and medium noise.
