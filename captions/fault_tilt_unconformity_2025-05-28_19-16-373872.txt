this model depicts a model with a structural discontinuity with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
we see here a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a rigid deformation known or fault with a tilt with a nonconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a section with a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity of low frequency and high noise.
