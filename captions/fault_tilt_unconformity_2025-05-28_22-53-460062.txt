we observe here a subsurface representation of a tectonic fault with a tilted horizontal beds with a disconformity.
this model depicts a section with a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilt with a nonconformity.
we observe here a sesimic section of medium frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a structural discontinuity with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity with medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section of medium frequency and low noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation with a geologic rigid deformation of a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
