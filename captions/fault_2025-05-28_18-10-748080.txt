we observe here a seismic image with a structural deformation.
this image represents a section with a horizons displacement along fault with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a seismic image with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a rigid deformation known or fault.
we observe here a model with a horizons displacement along fault.
this model depicts a seismic image of a structural discontinuity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a dip-slip fault.
