we observe here a model with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a dip-slip fault of an antiform of a tectonic tilting with high frequency and high noise.
we see here a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of an anticline with an inclined horizontal beds of high frequency and high noise.
