this model depicts a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a seismic image with a dip-slip fault with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a geologic rigid deformation with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a subsurface representation with a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a subsurface representation with low frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a horizons displacement along fault with a tectonic tilting with low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a structural discontinuity of a tilt with low frequency and low noise.
