this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with a folded deformation with a tilt.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of an antiform of a tilt.
this image represents a section with a ductile deformation with a tectonic tilting.
we see here a sesimic section with medium frequency and medium noise.
