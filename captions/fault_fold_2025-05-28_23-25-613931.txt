this image represents a subsurface model of a tectonic fault with a folded deformation.
we see here a subsurface representation of high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a model with a fault of a structural compression with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of high frequency and medium noise.
