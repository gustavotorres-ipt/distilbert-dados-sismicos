this image represents a 2D section with a dip-slip fault of a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
