this image represents a model of an antiform of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a section of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds with an unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a ductile deformation with an inclined horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a model of high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity with high frequency and high noise.
we observe here a 2D section of a ductile deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
