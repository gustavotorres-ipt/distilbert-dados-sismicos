this image represents a 2D section with a structural compression with a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a folded deformation of a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity with low frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section of an anticline of a tilt of an erosional unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface model of a fold of a tilt with an angular unconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a fold with a tectonic tilting with an unconformity.
