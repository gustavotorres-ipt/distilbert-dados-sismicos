this image represents a 2D section with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic compression of a nonconformity.
we see here a section of a structural deformation with an anticline with an unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
this image demonstrates a model of a fault of a fold of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface representation of medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a model with a tectonic deformation of an anticline with an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault with a tectonic compression of an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a section of a dip-slip fault of a ductile deformation with a nonconformity of medium frequency and high noise.
