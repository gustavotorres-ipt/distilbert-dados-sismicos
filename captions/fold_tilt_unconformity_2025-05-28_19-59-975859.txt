this model depicts a sesimic section with a tectonic compression of a subsurface layer rotation of an unconformity.
this model depicts a section with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a sesimic section of high frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a model with an anticline with a subsurface layer rotation of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section of high frequency and medium noise.
