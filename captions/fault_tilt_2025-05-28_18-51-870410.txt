this model depicts a subsurface model of a fault with a subsurface layer rotation.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of low frequency and low noise.
this image demonstrates a seismic image of a rigid deformation known or fault of an inclined horizontal beds of low frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a model of a geologic rigid deformation of a tilt.
we see here a subsurface representation of a dip-slip fault of a subsurface layer rotation.
