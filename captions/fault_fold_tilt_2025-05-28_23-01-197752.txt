we observe here a sesimic section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault with a folded deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
we see here a seismic image with a horizons displacement along fault of a folded deformation with an inclined horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a section with a structural discontinuity with a tectonic compression with a tectonic tilting.
we observe here a sesimic section of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a fault with a structural compression with an inclined horizontal beds with medium frequency and medium noise.
