we see here a seismic image with high frequency and high noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity of high frequency and high noise.
this model depicts a seismic image with a subsurface layer rotation with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a section of an inclined horizontal beds with a disconformity of high frequency and high noise.
