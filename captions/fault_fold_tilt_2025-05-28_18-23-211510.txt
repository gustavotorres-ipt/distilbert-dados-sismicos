this model depicts a 2D section of a dip-slip fault with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault of an antiform with a tectonic tilting of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation of a fault with a structural compression of a tilt.
