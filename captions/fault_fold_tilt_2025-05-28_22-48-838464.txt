this image represents a 2D section of a horizons displacement along fault with a folded deformation with a tilt.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a fault with an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds.
we observe here a section of a rigid deformation known or fault of a ductile deformation of a tilt.
we observe here a section with a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform with a subsurface layer rotation.
we see here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
