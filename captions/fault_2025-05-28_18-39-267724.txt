this image demonstrates a seismic image of a structural deformation.
this image represents a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a fault.
this image represents a 2D section of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a dip-slip fault.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with low frequency and medium noise.
