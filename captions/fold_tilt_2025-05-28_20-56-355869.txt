we see here a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic compression with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a model with a ductile deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a section of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
