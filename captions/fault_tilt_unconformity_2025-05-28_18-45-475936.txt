this image represents a sesimic section of a rigid deformation known or fault of an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity of a tectonic tilting of an angular unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a geologic rigid deformation with a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
we see here a model with a tectonic deformation of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D section with a fault with a tilted horizontal beds with an angular unconformity.
