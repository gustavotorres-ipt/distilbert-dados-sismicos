we observe here a sesimic section with a ductile deformation of a tilt.
we observe here a subsurface model of a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a section of an antiform with an inclined horizontal beds of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section with a tectonic compression with a tilted horizontal beds of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a folded deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
