this model depicts a seismic image with a structural discontinuity with an inclined horizontal beds.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation with high frequency and low noise.
we observe here a section of high frequency and low noise.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic fault of a subsurface layer rotation.
this model depicts a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a model with high frequency and low noise.
