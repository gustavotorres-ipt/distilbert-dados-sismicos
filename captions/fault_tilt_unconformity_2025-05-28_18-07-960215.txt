we see here a subsurface model of low frequency and low noise.
we observe here a seismic image with a tectonic deformation of a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a tectonic fault of an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface representation of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tilt of an unconformity.
