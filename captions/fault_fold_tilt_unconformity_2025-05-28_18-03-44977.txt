this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a tectonic deformation with an anticline of a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this model depicts a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation with a fold with a tilt with an unconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a horizons displacement along fault of a structural compression of a tilt with an angular unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model with a geologic rigid deformation with an antiform of a tilt of a disconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of an anticline with a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a fault with a fold with a tectonic tilting with an erosional unconformity.
