this image represents a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model with a fault of a tectonic tilting with a disconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault of a tectonic tilting of a disconformity of medium frequency and low noise.
we see here a 2D section of a fault with an inclined horizontal beds of a nonconformity.
