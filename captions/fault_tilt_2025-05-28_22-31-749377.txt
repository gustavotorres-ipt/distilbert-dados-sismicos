this image represents a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
we observe here a model of low frequency and low noise.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural deformation with a tilt of low frequency and low noise.
this image represents a 2D section of a dip-slip fault of a tectonic tilting.
we see here a section of a structural discontinuity of a subsurface layer rotation.
this image represents a section with a structural deformation of an inclined horizontal beds.
