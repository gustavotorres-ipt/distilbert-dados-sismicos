this image represents a subsurface representation of high frequency and low noise.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with a model with no structural deformation.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of a layer-cake stratigraphy section.
we observe here a sesimic section with a layer-cake structural model.
we observe here a subsurface representation with high frequency and low noise.
