we observe here a subsurface representation with a subsurface layer rotation with a disconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of a tilted horizontal beds of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model of a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image with a tectonic tilting with a disconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface model with a tilt with an erosional unconformity.
