this image demonstrates a sesimic section with an anticline with a tilt with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a section of a fold with a subsurface layer rotation with an unconformity.
we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression of an inclined horizontal beds with an erosional unconformity.
