this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model of an anticline of an unconformity.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a ductile deformation of an erosional unconformity.
this image represents a 2D section with a folded deformation with a disconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with an anticline of a nonconformity.
