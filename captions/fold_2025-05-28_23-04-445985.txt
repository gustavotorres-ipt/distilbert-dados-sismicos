we observe here a 2D subsurface model of a tectonic compression of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a sesimic section with a ductile deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section of an antiform.
this image represents a subsurface model with a folded deformation.
