we observe here a sesimic section of an antiform with an erosional unconformity of high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D section of a folded deformation with an angular unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section of a structural compression with a nonconformity.
this image demonstrates a 2D subsurface model with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with an anticline with an unconformity.
