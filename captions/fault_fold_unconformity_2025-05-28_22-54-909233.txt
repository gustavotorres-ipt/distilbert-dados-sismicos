this image demonstrates a subsurface model of a rigid deformation known or fault of a tectonic compression of a disconformity.
we observe here a seismic image of a tectonic deformation of a fold of an angular unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a structural deformation of a folded deformation of an unconformity.
