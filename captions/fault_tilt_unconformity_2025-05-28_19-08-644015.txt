this image demonstrates a seismic image of medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image with a structural deformation of a subsurface layer rotation of an angular unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation of a tilt with a nonconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a 2D section of medium frequency and medium noise.
