this model depicts a subsurface model of a horizons displacement along fault of a nonconformity.
we observe here a subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with an angular unconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
this image represents a subsurface model with a horizons displacement along fault with a disconformity.
