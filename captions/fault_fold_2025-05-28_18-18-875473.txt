this model depicts a seismic image with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a 2D section with a fault with a folded deformation with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a structural discontinuity with an anticline.
we see here a section with a tectonic fault with a tectonic compression with medium frequency and medium noise.
