we see here a subsurface representation with a fault of an anticline of a tilted horizontal beds.
we see here a subsurface representation of a tectonic deformation with a ductile deformation of a tilted horizontal beds.
this model depicts a sesimic section of a fault with a folded deformation with a tilted horizontal beds.
this image demonstrates a subsurface representation with low frequency and low noise.
