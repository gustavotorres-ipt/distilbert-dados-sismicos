this image demonstrates a seismic image of a geologic rigid deformation of a structural compression of a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
we see here a section of a geologic rigid deformation with a folded deformation with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model with medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of a folded deformation with an unconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a geologic rigid deformation of an antiform of an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with medium frequency and medium noise.
