we observe here a model with a rigid deformation known or fault of an angular unconformity.
this image demonstrates a sesimic section of a geologic rigid deformation of a disconformity.
we see here a subsurface representation with a structural discontinuity with an erosional unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section with a tectonic fault with an erosional unconformity.
we see here a sesimic section of a tectonic deformation of a disconformity.
this model depicts a section with a tectonic fault with a disconformity.
this image represents a section with medium frequency and medium noise.
