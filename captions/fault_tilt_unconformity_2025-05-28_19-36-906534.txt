this model depicts a section of a structural deformation of a tilt with an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a model of a structural discontinuity with an inclined horizontal beds of an erosional unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a subsurface representation with a fault with a tilt of a nonconformity.
we observe here a seismic image with a fault with a subsurface layer rotation of a disconformity.
this image represents a 2D subsurface model with a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with an unconformity with high frequency and medium noise.
we see here a seismic image of a fault of a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity.
