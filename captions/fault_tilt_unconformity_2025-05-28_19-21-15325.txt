this image represents a subsurface model with a structural deformation with a tilted horizontal beds with a nonconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
this model depicts a 2D section with a horizons displacement along fault of a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a sesimic section with a tectonic deformation with a subsurface layer rotation with an angular unconformity of medium frequency and medium noise.
we observe here a section with a dip-slip fault with an inclined horizontal beds of an unconformity with medium frequency and medium noise.
