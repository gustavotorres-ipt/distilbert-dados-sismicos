this model depicts a model with a horizons displacement along fault of a subsurface layer rotation of an erosional unconformity.
this model depicts a 2D section with a rigid deformation known or fault with an inclined horizontal beds of a disconformity.
we see here a 2D subsurface model of a structural discontinuity with a tilt of an unconformity.
this model depicts a seismic image of a tectonic deformation with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
we see here a seismic image of a fault with a tilted horizontal beds of an unconformity.
this image represents a subsurface model of low frequency and medium noise.
this image demonstrates a section of a tectonic fault of a tectonic tilting with a nonconformity of low frequency and medium noise.
